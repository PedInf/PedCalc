Use with caution in patients with preexisting neurologic or renal impairment  or dehydration. Adequate hydration and slow (1 hr) IV administration are essential to prevent
crystallization in renal tubules. 
Do not use topical product on the eye or for the prevention of recurrent HSV infections. 
Oral absorption is unpredictable (15%–30%); consider using valacyclovir or famciclovir for better absorption. 
Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. 
Resistant strains of HSV and VZV have been reported in immunocompromised patients (e.g., advanced HIV infection).
Inflammation or phlebitis at the injection site and transient elevations of sCr and BUN are the most frequent IV use side effects. Can cause renal impairment and has been associated with headache, vertigo,
insomnia, encephalopathy, GI tract irritation, elevated liver function tests, rash, urticaria, arthralgia, fever, and adverse hematologic effects. Probenecid decreases acyclovir renal clearance.
Acyclovir may increase the concentration of tenofovir, and meperidine and its metabolite (normeperidine).
Topical cream acyclovir 5% in combination with hydrocortisone 1% (Xerese) is indicated for herpes labialis (≥6 yr and adults) at a dosage of 5 applications per day for 5 days. Use a finger cot or
rubber glove when applying topical cream or ointment.

Use with caution in preexisting renal, vestibular, or auditory impairment; concomitant anesthesia or neuromuscular blockers, neurotoxic; concomitant neurotoxic, ototoxic, or nephrotoxic drugs; sulfite sensitivity; and dehydration. 
Adjust dose in renal failure. 
Longer dosing intervals may be necessary for neonates receiving indomethacin for PDAs and for all patients with poor cardiac output. 
Rapidly eliminated in patients with cystic fibrosis, burns, and in febrile neutropenic patients. CNS penetration is poor beyond early infancy.

Therapeutic levels (using conventional dosing): peak, 20–30 mg/L; trough, 5–10 mg/L. 
Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: trough within 30 min before the third consecutive dose and peak 30–60 minutes after the administration of the third consecutive dose. 
Peak levels of 25–30 mg/L have been recommended for CNS, pulmonary, bone, life-threatening, and Pseudomonas infections and in febrile neutropenic patients.
Therapeutic levels for cystic fibrosis using high-dose extended-interval (once daily) dosing: peak, 80–120 mg/L; trough, <10 mg/L. 
Recommended serum sampling time: trough within 30 minutes before the dose and peak 30–60 minutes after administration of dose.
For initial dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 (Total Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight).
May cause ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neuromuscular blockade, and rash. Loop diuretics may potentiate the ototoxicity of all aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Neonatal apnea:
             Loading dose: 5–6 mg/kg IV
             Maintenance dose: 1–2 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr, IV
Asthma exacerbation and reactive airway disease:
               IV loading: 6 mg/kg IV over 20 min (each 1.2 mg/kg dose raises the serum theophylline concentration 2 mg/L)
               IV maintenance: Continuous IV drip:
                      Neonate: 0.2 mg/kg/hr
                      6 wk–6 mo: 0.5 mg/kg/hr
                      6 mo–1 yr: 0.6–0.7 mg/kg/hr
                       1–9 yr: 1–1.2 mg/kg/hr
                       9–12 yr and young adult smoker: 0.9 mg/kg/hr
                       >12 yr healthy nonsmoker: 0.7 mg/kg/hr
The above total daily doses may also be administered IV ÷ Q4–6 hr.

Consider milligrams of theophylline available when dosing aminophylline. For oral route of administration, use theophylline.
Monitoring serum levels is essential, especially in infants and young children. Intermittent dosing for infants and children 1–5 yr may require Q4 hr dosing regimen due to enhanced metabolism/clearance. Side effects: restlessness, GI upset, headache, tachycardia, seizures (may occur in absence of other side effects with toxic levels).
Therapeutic level (as theophylline): for asthma, 10–20 mg/L; for neonatal apnea, 6–13 mg/L.

Recommended guidelines for obtaining levels:
              IV bolus: 30 min after infusion
              IV continuous; 12–24 hr after initiation of infusion 
              PO liquid, immediate-release tab (theophylline product):
                     Peak: 1 hr post dose
                     Trough: just before dose
             PO sustained-release (theophylline product):
                   Peak: 4 hr post dose
                   Trough: just before dose

Ideally, obtain levels after steady state has been achieved (after at least one day of therapy). Liver impairment, cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. 
Use in breast feeding may cause irritability in infant. 
It is recommended to avoid breast feeding for 2 hr after IV or 4 hr after immediate-release oral intermittent dose."

*********************
Child PO for tachyarrhythmia:
               <1 yr: 600–800 mg/1.73 m2/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr × 4–14 days and/or until adequate control achieved, then reduce to 200–400 mg/1.73 m2/24 hr.
               ≥1 yr: 10–15 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr × 4–14 days and/or until adequate control achieved, then reduce to 5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr if effective.

Child IV for tachyarrhythmia (limited data):
              5 mg/kg (max. dose: 300 mg) over 30 min followed by a continuous infusion starting at 5 micrograms (mCg)/kg/min; infusion may be increased up to a max. dose of 15 mCg/kg/min or 20 mg/kg/24 hr or 2200 mg/24 hr.

Adult PO for ventricular arrhythmias:
          Loading dose: 800–1600 mg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr for 1–3 wk
          Maintenance: 600–800 mg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr × 1 mo, then 200 mg Q12–24 hr
Use lowest effective dose to minimize adverse reactions.

Adult IV for ventricular arrhythmias:
         Loading dose: 150 mg over 10 min (15 mg/min) followed by 360 mg over 6 hr (1 mg/min); followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/min. 
         Supplemental boluses of 150 mg over 10 min may be given for breakthrough VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, and the maintenance infusion may be increased to suppress the arrhythmia. Max. dose: 2.1 g/24 hr.

Used in the resuscitation algorithm for ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (see front cover for arrest dosing and back cover for PALS algorithm).
Overall use of this drug may be limited to its potentially life-threatening side effects and the difficulties associated with managing its use.

Contraindicated in severe sinus node dysfunction, marked sinus bradycardia, second- and third degree AV block. Use with caution in hepatic impairment. 
Long elimination half-life (40–55 days). Major metabolite is active. Use of premixed injection (Nexterone) is not recommended in renal insufficiency due to accumulation of cyclodextrin excipient.

Increases cyclosporine, digoxin, phenytoin, tacrolimus, warfarin, calcium channel blockers, theophyl-line, and quinidine levels. Amiodarone is a CYP P450 3A3/4 substrate and inhibits CYP 3A3/4, 2C9,and 2D6. Risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased when used with simvastatin at doses greater than 20 mg/24 hr and lovastatin at doses greater than 40 mg/24 hr. Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported when used with sofosbuvir.

Proposed therapeutic level with chronic oral use: 1–2.5 mg/L.

Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits should appear in all patients. Alters liver enzymes, thyroid function. Pulmonary fibrosis reported in adults. May cause worsening of preexisting arrhythmias with
bradycardia and AV block. May also cause hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, paresthesias, ataxia, tremor, SIADH, and hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Drug rash with eosinophiliae systemic symptoms and acute respiratory distress has been reported
Correct hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia whenever possible before use as these conditions may exaggerate QTc prolongation.
Intravenous continuous infusion concentration for peripheral administration should not exceed 2 mg/mL and must be diluted with D5W. The intravenous dosage form can leach out plasticizers such as DEHP. 
It is recommended to reduce the potential exposure to plasticizers in pregnant women and children at the toddler stages of development and younger by using alternative methods of IV drug administration.
Oral administration should be consistent with regards to meals because food increases the rate and extent of oral absorption."
Amitriptyline,"Antidepressant, tricyclic (TCA)
***************************
Antidepressant:
                 Child: Start with 1 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID PO for 3 days; then increase to 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr.
                                   Dose may be gradually increased to a max. dose of 5 mg/kg/24 hr, if needed. Monitor ECG, BP, and heart rate for doses > 3 mg/kg/24 hr.
                 Adolescent: 10 mg TID PO and 20 mg QHS; dose may be gradually increased up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr if needed.
                 Adult: 40–100 mg/24 hr ÷ QHS-BID PO; dose may be gradually increased up to 300 mg/24 hr, if needed; gradually decrease dose to lowest effective dose when symptoms are controlled.

Augment analgesia for chronic pain:
                  Child: Initial: 0.1 mg/kg/dose QHS PO; increase as needed and tolerated over 2–3 wk to 0.5–2 mg/kg/dose QHS.

Migrane prophylaxis (limited data):
                   Child: Initial 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/dose QHS PO; increase as needed and tolerated every 2 wk by 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/dose up to a max. dose of 2 mg/kg/24 hr or 75 mg/24 hr. For doses > 1 mg/ kg/24 hr, divide daily dose BID and monitor ECG.
                   Adult: Initial 10–25 mg/dose QHS PO; reported range of 10–400 mg/24 hr.

Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma, seizures, severe cardiac disorders, and patients who received MAO inhibitors within 14 days. See Chapter 2 for management of TCA toxic ingestion.
T1/2 = 9–25 hr in adults. Maximum antidepressant effects may not occur for 2 wk or more after initiation of therapy. Do not abruptly discontinue therapy in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods.
Therapeutic levels (sum of amitriptyline and nortriptyline): 100–250 ng/mL. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain a single level 8 hr or more after an oral dose (following 4–5 days of continuous dosing). Amitriptyline is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4 and inhibitor for CYP 450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1. Rifampin can decrease amitriptyline levels.
Amitriptyline may increase side effects of tramadol.

Side effects include sedation, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, liver enzyme elevation, and arrhythmia. May discolor urine (blue/green). QHS dosing during first weeks of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, and CBC at start of therapy and with dose changes.

Decrease dose if PR interval reaches 0.22 s, QRS reaches 130% of baseline, HR rises above 140/min, or if BP is > 140/90. Tricyclics may cause mania. For antidepressant use, monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes."

**************************************
Child:
            Hypertension: Start with 0.1 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 5 mg) PO once daily–BID; dosage may be gradually increased to a max. dose of 0.6 mg/kg/24 hr up to 20 mg/24 hr. 
            An effective antihypertensive dose of 2.5–5 mg once daily for those aged 6–17 yr has been reported,and doses > 5 mg have not been evaluated.
Adult:
             Hypertension: 5–10 mg/dose once daily PO; use 2.5 mg/dose once daily PO in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Max. dose: 10 mg/24 hr.

Use with caution in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Younger children (<6 yr) may require higher mg/kg doses than older children and adults. A BID dosing regimen may provide better efficacy in children.
Reduce dose in hepatic insufficiency. Allow 5–7 days of continuous initial dose therapy before making dosage adjustments because of the drug’s gradual onset of action and lengthy elimination half-life.
Amlodipine is a substrate of CYP 450 3A4 and should be used with caution with 3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and azole antifungals (eg. fluconazole and ketoconazole). 
May increase levels and toxicity of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and simvastatin.
Dose-related side effects include edema, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, and palpitations. 
Other side effects include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence."

Adjust dose in renal failure .
Contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Augmentin XR is contraindicated in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min.
Clavulanic acid extends the activity of amoxicillin to include β-lactamase–producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and some Staphylococcus aureus and may increase the risk for diarrhea.
The BID dosing schedule is associated with less diarrhea. 
For BID dosing, the 875-mg, 1-g tablets;the 200-mg, 400-mg chewable tablets; or the 200-mg/5 mL, 400-mg/5 mL, 600-mg/5 mL suspensions should be used.

IV: mix with D5W to a concentration 0.1 mg/mL (peripheral administration) or 0.25 mg/mL (central line only). pH > 4.2. Infuse over 2–6 hr.
Optional test dose: 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV up to max. dose of 1 mg (followed by remaining initial dose).

Initial dose: 0.5–1 mg/kg/24 hr; if test dose NOT used, infuse first dose over 6 hr and monitor frequently during the first several hours.
Increment: Increase as tolerated by 0.25–0.5 mg/kg/24 hr once daily or every other day. Use larger dosage increments (0.5 mg once daily) for critically ill patients.

Usual maintenance:
            Once-daily dosing: 0.5–1 mg/kg/24 hr once daily
            Every-other-day dosing: 1.5 mg/kg/dose every other day

Monitor renal, hepatic, electrolyte, and hematologic status closely. Hypercalciuria, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, RTA, renal failure, acute hepatic failure, hypotension, and phlebitis may occur. For dosing information in renal failure,
Common infusion-related reactions include fever, chills, headache, hypotension, nausea, vomiting; may premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 30 min before and 4 hr after infusion.
Meperidine useful for chills. Hydrocortisone, 1 mg/mg ampho (max.: 25 mg) added to bottle may help prevent immediate adverse reactions. Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages.
Salt loading with 10–15 mL/kg of NS infused prior to each dose may minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity. 
Maintaining sodium intake of >4 mEq/kg/24 hr in premature neonates may also reduce risk for nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, chemotherapeutic agents, and cyclosporine may result in synergistic toxicity. Hypokalemia may increase the toxicity of neuromuscular blocking agents and cardiac glycosides."

Risk of benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia may be increased in infants aged ≤3 mo."
Arginine,"Metabolic alkalosis agent, urea cycle disorder treatment agent, growth hormone diagnostic agent
*************************************************************************************
Used as a secondary alternative agent for patients that are unresponsive or unable to receive sodium chloride and potassium chloride.

Correction of hypochloremia: Arginine chloride dose in milliequivalents (mEq) = 0.2 × patient’s weight (kg) × [103 − patient’s serum chloride in mEq/L]. Administer 12 to 23 of the calculated dose and reassess.

Drug administration: Do not exceed an IV infusion rate of 1 g/kg/hr (4.75 mEq/kg/hr). Drug may be administered without further dilution, but should be diluted to reduce risk of tissue irritation.
Hyperammonemia in metabolic disorders: See Chapter 13, Treatment of Metabolic Crisis Contraindicated in renal or hepatic failure. Use with extreme caution as overdose may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, cerebral edema, and death. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and hematuria have been reported.

Arginine hydrochloride is metabolized to nitrogen-containing products for renal excretion. 
Excess arginine increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) to cause vasodilation/hypotension. 
Closely monitor acid/base status. Hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, GI disturbances, IV extravasation, headache, and flushing may occur.
In addition to its use in chloride supplementation, arginine is used in urea cycle disorder therapy (increases arginine levels and prevents breakdown of endogenous proteins) and as a diagnostic agent for growth hormone (stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone).

Contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant and with concurrent use of cyclosporine (increases bosentan concentrations) or glyburide (increases risk for hepatotoxicity). Due to these risks, bosentan is available only through the Tracleer REMS program where prescribers and pharmacies need to be certified. 

Baseline and monthly monitoring of serum aminotransferases and bilirubin; and pregnancy tests for females of reproductive potential (two forms of birth control required) are required. 
Use should be avoided in patients with preexisting hepatic impairment (baseline aminotransferases >3 times the usual normal limit).
May cause respiratory tract infections, anemia (dose related), edema, increased liver aminotransferases (see dosage modification; higher incidence in adults) and pyrexia. 
Decreased sperm counts, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, DRESS, thrombocytopenia, and sinusitis have been reported.
Bosentan is substrate for the CYP2C9 and 3A4 enzymes, and OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 transporter. 
It also induces CYP2C9 and 3A4; may decrease sildenafil levels. 
Reduces the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

Contraindicated for patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or who are sensitive to tricyclic antidepressants. 
They should not be used in combination with clozapine because of an increased risk for bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis. 
Increased risk for severe dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN]) has been associated with the HLA-B*1502 (prevalent among Asian
descent) and HLA-A*3101 (prevalent among Japanese, Native American, Southern Indians, and some Arabic ancestory) alleles.
Erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, cefixime, cimetidine, itraconazole, aprepitant, and INH may increase serum levels. 
Carbamazepine may decrease activity of warfarin, doxycycline, oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, theophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and valproic acid. 
Carbamazepine is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and inducer of CYP 450 1A2, 2C, and 3A3/4.
The enzyme-inducing effects may increase effects/toxicity of cyclophosphamide. 
CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase carbamazepine levels/toxicity.
Suggested dosing intervals for specific dosage forms: extended-release tabs or caps (BID); chewable and immediate-release tablets (BID–TID); suspension (QID).
Doses may be administered with food. Do not crush or chew extended-release dosage forms. 
Shake bottle well prior to dispensing oral suspension dosage form, and do not administer simultaneously with other liquid medicines or diluents.
Drug metabolism typically increases after the first month of therapy initiation because of hepatic autoinduction.
Therapeutic blood levels: 4–12 mg/L. 
Recommended serum sampling time: obtain trough level within 30 min prior to an oral dose. 
Steady state is typically achieved 1 mo after initiation of therapy (following enzymatic autoinduction). 
Levels obtained prior to steady state are useful for preventing toxicity. 
Blood levels of 7–10 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders.
Side effects include sedation, dizziness, diplopia, aplastic anemia, neutropenia, urinary retention, nausea, SIADH, and SJS. Suicidal behavior or ideation and onychomadesis have been reported.
About 1/3 of patients who have hypersensitivity reactions will also experience hypersensitivity to oxcarbazepine. 
Pretreatment complete blood counts (CBCs) and liver function tests (LFTs) are suggested. 
Patient should be monitored for hematologic and hepatic toxicity. 
Most common side effects with the IV route, dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, infusion-related reaction, infusion site pain and anemia.
Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 30).
Do not use IV dosage form in moderate/severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) due to accumulation of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium which may be nephrotoxic."

                  Adult: Start with 0.45 mCg/kg/dose IV/SC once every 4 wk
See details for dose adjustments and Conversion from epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa 

Contraindicated in uncontrolled hypertension and patients hypersensitive to albumin/ polysorbate 80 or epoetin alfa. Darbepoetin alfa is not intended for patients requiring acute
correction of anemia. Use with caution in seizures and liver disease. Erythema multiforme, SJS, and TEN have been reported. Evaluate serum iron, feritin, and TIBC; concurrent iron
supplementation may be necessary. Red cell aplasia and severe anemia associated with neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported.

USE IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Higher doses may be needed for pediatric patients being switched from epoetin alfa than those for naïve patients. May cause edema, fatigue, GI disturbances, headache, blood pressure changes, fever, cardiac arrhythmia/arrest, infections and myalgia. Higher risk for mortality and serious cardiovascular events have been reported with higher targeted hemoglobin
levels (>11 g/dL). If hemoglobin levels do not increase or reach targeted levels despite appropriate dose titrations over a 12 wk period, (1) do not administer higher doses and use the lowest dose that
will maintain hemoglobin levels to avoid the need for recurrent blood transfusions; (2) evaluate and treat other causes of anemia; (3) always follow the dose adjustment instructions; and (4) discontinue
use if patient remains transfusion dependent.

USE IN CANCER: Use only for anemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy; not effective in reducing the need for transfusions in patients with anemia not due to chemotherapy. Shortened survival and
time to tumor progression have been reported in patients with various cancers. May cause fatigue, fever, edema, dizziness, headache, GI disturbances, arthralgia/myalgia, and rash. Use lowest dose to
avoid transfusions and do not exceed hemoglobin levels >12 g/dL; increased frequency of adverse events, including mortality and thrombotic vascular events, have been reported. Prescribers and
hospitals must enroll in and comply with the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program to prescribe and/or dispense this drug to cancer patients.

        Further dose reduction to 1 drop TID–QID may be sufficient to control symptoms.
   Suspension: Shake well before using. Instill 1–2 drops in the conjunctival sac(s) of the affected eye(s) up to 4–6 times/24 hr. For severe disease, drops may be Q1 hr, which is tapered to discontinuation as inflammation subsides. For mild disease, drops may be used ≤4–6 times/24 hr.

Not recommended for systemic therapy in the prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease in infants with very low birth weight because of increased risk for adverse events.
Dexamethasone is a substrate of CYP450 3A3/4 and P-glycoprotein. Compared with prednisone, dexamethasone has no mineralocorticoid effects with greater glucocorticoid effects. Consider use of alternative low glucocorticoid systemic steroid for patients with hyperglycemia. Contraindicated in active untreated infections and fungal, viral, and mycobacterial ocular infections.
Oral peak serum levels occur 1–2 hr and within 8 hr following IM administration. For other uses, doses based on body surface area, and dose equivalence to other steroids, .

OPHTHALMIC USE: Use ophthalmic preparation only in consultation with an ophthalmologist. Use with caution in corneal/scleral thinning and glaucoma. Consider the possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea after prolonged use. Ophthalmic solution/suspension may be used in otitis externa"
Dexmedetomidine,"Alpha-Adrenergic agonist, sedative
****************************

NOTE: Maintenance infusion rate dosing metric is mcg/kg/HR

ICU sedation:
    Child (limited data): 0.5–1 mcg/kg/dose IV × 1 over 10 min followed by 0.2–1 mcg/kg/hr infusion titrated to effect. Children <1 yr of age may require higher dosages.
    Adult: 1 mcg/kg/dose IV × 1 over 10 min, followed by 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr infusion and titrated to effect.

Procedural sedation:
    Child (limited data):
          IV: 2 mcg/kg/dose × 1 IV followed by 1.5 mcg/kg/hr was administered to children with autism/pervasive developmental disorders for sedation for electroencephalography (EEG).
          IM: 1–4.5 mcg/kg/dose × 1 IM was administered to children for sedation for EEG. Extremely anxious, inconsolable, aggressive, and noncompliant children received doses of >2.5 mcg/kg and  calm and relatively compliant children received doses of ≤2.5 mcg/kg. A second lower repeat dose (~2 mcg/kg/dose IM) was administered because adequate sedation was not achieved after 10 min of the first dose.

Intranasal route (limited data): 1–2 mcg/kg/dose × 1 for premedication anesthesia induction.
Adult: 1 mcg/kg/dose IV × 1 over 10 min, followed by 0.6 mcg/kg/hr titrated to effect; dosage has ranged from 0.2–1 mcg/kg/hr.


Use with caution with other vasodilating or negative chronotropic agents (additive pharmacodynamic effects), hepatic impairment (decrease drug clearance; consider dose reduction), advanced heart block, hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, and severe ventricular dysfunction. Prolonged use >24 hr may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and dose-related side effects (ARDS, respiratory failure, and agitation). Hypotension and bradycardia are common side effects; may be more pronounced in hypovolemia, diabetes, or chronic hypertension. Transient hypertension has been observed during loading doses. QT prolongation, hypernatremia, sinus arrest, and polyuria have been reported. Do not abruptly withdraw therapy as withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and agitation) are possible; taper the
dose when discontinuing use. Use with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids may lead to enhanced effects; consider dosage reduction of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is a CYP450 2A6 substrate and a weak inhibitor of CYP450 1A2, 2C9, and 3A4. Onset of action for procedural sedation: IV or IM: 15 min, intranasal: 15–30 min. Duration of action for procedural sedation: IM: 1 hr, intranasal: 1–1.5 hr.
This drug should be administered by individuals skilled in the management of patients in the ICU and OR. Concentrated IV solution (200 mcg/2 mL) must be diluted with normal saline (NS) to a concentration of 4 mcg/mL prior to administration. See Chapter 6 for additional information"

CONVERTING FROM IMMEDIATE-RELEASE TABS (BID) TO EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPS (once daily)
DEXMETHYLPHENIDATE: Use the equivalent mg dosage amount. Dexmethylphenidate is the d-enantiomer of methylphenidate and accounts for the majority of clinical effects for methylphenidate. Contraindicated in glaucoma, anxiety disorders, motor tics, and Tourette syndrome. Do not use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor; hypertensive crisis may occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of MAO inhibitor.
See methylphendate for additional warnings and drug interactions. Common side effects include abdominal pain, indigestion, appetite suppression, nausea, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud phenomenon, and priapism have been reported. Immediate-release tablets are dosed BID (minimum 4 hr between doses), and extended-release capsules are dosed once daily. Contents of the extended-release capsule may be sprinkled on a spoonful of applesauce and consumed immediately for those who are unable to swallow capsules"
Dextroamphetamine ± Amphetamine,"CNS stimulant, amphetamine
***********************

Dosages are in terms of mg of dextroamphetamine when using dextroamphetamine alone OR in terms of mg of the total dextroamphetamine and amphetamine salts when using
Adderall. Nonextended-release dosage forms are usually given BID–TID (first dose on awakening and subsequent doses at intervals of 4–6 hr later). Extended/sustainedreleased dosage forms are usually given PO once daily, sometimes BID.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder:
     3–5 yr: 2.5 mg/24 hr QAM; increase by 2.5 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals to a max. dose of 40 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID (some may require TID dosing).
     ≥6 yr: 5 mg/24 hr QAM; increase by 5 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals to a max. dose of 40 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID (some may require TID dosing). Max. dose of 60 mg/24 hr has been used patients >50 kg.

Narcolepsy:
       6–12 yr: 5 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–TID; increase by 5 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals to a max. dose of 60 mg/24 hr
       >12 yr and adult: 10 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–TID; increase by 10 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals to a max. dose of 60 mg/24 hr

Use with caution in the presence of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Avoid use in known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase risk for sympathomimetic effects of amphetamines (sudden death, stroke, and MI have
been reported). Do not administer with MAO inhibitors (also within 14 days of discontinuance) or general anesthetics. Use with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce
the effectiveness of either dextroamphetamine or the combination with amphetamine. Not recommended for <3 yr. Medication should generally not be used in children aged <5 yr as
diagnosis of ADHD in this age group is extremely difficult (use in consultation with a specialist). Interrupt administration occasionally to determine need for continued therapy. Many side effects,
including insomnia (avoid dose administration within 6 hr of bedtime), restlessness/irritability, anorexia, psychosis, visual disturbances, headache, vomiting, abdominal cramps, dry mouth, and
growth failure. Paranoia, mania, peripheral vasculopathy (including Raynaud phenomenon), priapism, bruxism, and auditory hallucination have been reported. Tolerance develops. Same
guidelines as for methylphenidate apply. See Amphetamine for amphetamine-only–containing product"

         6–11 yr: 0.3 mg/kg/dose
         ≥12 yr: and adult: 0.2 mg/kg/dose
           Max. dose (all ages): 20 mg/dose

Contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic failure, and sleep apnea syndrome. Hypotension and respiratory depression may occur. Use with
caution in hepatic and renal dysfunction, glaucoma, shock, and depression. Do not use in combination with protease inhibitors. Concurrent use with CNS depressants, cimetidine,
erythromycin, itraconazole, and valproic acid may enhance the effects of diazepam. Diazepam is a substrate for CYP450 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A5–7 and is a minor substrate
and inhibitor for CYP450 2C19 and 3A3/4. The active desmethyldiazepam metabolite is a CYP450 2C19 substrate. Administer the conventional IV product undiluted no faster than 2 mg/min. Do not mix with IV fluids.
In status epilepticus, diazepam must be followed by long-acting anticonvulsants. Onset of anticonvulsant effect: 1–3 min with IV route; 2–10 min with rectal route"
Diazoxide,"Antihypoglycemic agent, antihypertensive agent
***************************************
Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (because of insulin-producing tumors; start at the lowest dose):
       Newborn and infant: 8–15 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8–12 hr PO; usual range: 5–20 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr
       Child and adult: 3–8 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8–12 hr PO

Hypoglycemia should be treated initially with IV glucose; diazoxide should be introduced only if refractory to glucose infusion. Should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to thiazides unless benefit outweighs risk. Thiazides may enhance diazoxide’s hyperglycemic effects. Use with caution in renal impairment (clearance of drug is reduced); consider dosage reduction.
Sodium and fluid retention is common in young infants and adults and may precipitate CHF in patients with compromised cardiac reserve (usually responsive to diuretics). Hirsutism (reversible),
GI disturbances, transient loss of taste, tachycardia, ketoacidosis, palpitations, rash, headache, weakness, and hyperuricemia may occur. Pulmonary hypertension in newborns/infant treated for
hypoglycemia has been reported as resolution/improvement of the condition was achieved after discontinuing diazoxide. Monitor BP closely for hypotension.
Hyperglycemic effect with PO administration occurs within 1 hr, with a duration of 8 hr"

Initial: 1/2 TDD, then 1/4 TDD Q8–18 hr × 2 doses; obtain electrocardiogram (ECG) 6 hr after dose to assess for toxicity

Maintenance:
       <10 yr: Give maintenance dose ÷ BID
         ≥10 yr: Give maintenance dose once daily

Contraindicated in patients with ventricular dysrhythmias. Use should be avoided in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Use with caution in renal failure, calcium
channel blockers (may result in heart block), and adenosine [enhanced depressant effects on sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes]. May cause AV block or dysrhythmias. In
patients treated with digoxin, cardioversion or calcium infusion may lead to ventricular fibrillation (pretreatment with lidocaine may prevent this). Patients with beriberi heart
disease may not respond to digoxin if underlying thiamine deficiency is not treated concomitantly. Decreased serum potassium and magnesium or increased magnesium and
calcium may increase risk for digoxin toxicity. For signs and symptoms of toxicity,. Excreted via the kidney; adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 30). Therapeutic concentration:
0.8–2 ng/mL. Higher doses may be required for supraventricular tachycardia. Neonates, pregnant women, and patients with renal, hepatic, or heart failure may have falsely elevated digoxin levels
because of the presence of digoxin-like substances. Digoxin is a CYP450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate. Calcium channel blockers, captopril, carvedilol, amiodarone, quinidine, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tetracycline, and macrolide antibiotics may increase digoxin levels. Use with β-blockers may increase risk for bradycardia. Succinylcholine may cause arrhythmias in digitalized patients.
T1/2: Premature infants, 61–170 hr; full-term neonates, 35–45 hr; infants, 18–25 hr; and children, 35 hr. Recommended serum sampling at steady state: Obtain a single level from 6 hr postdose to just before
the next scheduled dose following 5–8 days of continuous dosing. Levels obtained prior to steady state may be useful in preventing toxicity"
Digoxin Immune FAB (Ovine),"Antidigoxin antibody
*****************
Dosing based on known amounts of digoxin acutely ingested:
    First determine total body digoxin load (TBL):
            TBL (mg) = mg digoxin ingested × 0.8 
Then, calculate digoxin immune Fab dose:
    Dose in number of digoxin immune Fab vials (DigiFab): vials = TBL ÷ 0.5


Dosage Administration:
Reconstitute each vial with 4 mL NS for a 10 mg/mL concentration and infuse IV dose over 30 min. If an infusion rate reaction occurs, stop infusion and restart at a slower rate. In situations of cardiac
arrest, DigiFab can be administered as a bolus injection but has an increased risk for infusion-related reactions. For smaller doses, vials may be reconstituted with 36 mL NS for a 1 mg/mL concentration.
Contraindicated if hypersensitive to sheep products. Use with caution in renal or cardiac failure. May cause rapidly developing severe hypokalemia, decreased cardiac output (from withdrawal of digoxin’s inotropic effects), rash, edema, and phlebitis. Digoxin therapy may be reinstituted in 3–7 days when toxicity has been corrected. Digoxin immune FAB will interfere with digitalis immunoassay measurements to result in misleading concentrations"

capsule or tab); max. dose: 540 mg/24 hr.

Contraindicated in acute MI with pulmonary congestion, second- or third-degree heart block, and sick sinus syndrome. Use with caution in congestive heart failure (CHF) or
renal and hepatic impairment. Dizziness, headache, edema, nausea, vomiting, heart block, and arrhythmias may occur. Acute hepatic injury and severe skin reactions have been
reported. Monitor heart rate with concurrent clonidine use (sinus bradycardia has been reported). Diltiazem is a substrate and inhibitor of the CYP450 3A4 enzyme system. May increase levels and
effects/toxicity of buspirone, cyclosporine, carbamazepine, fentanyl, digoxin, quinidine, tacrolimus, benzodiazepines, and β-blockers. Cimetidine and statins may increase serum diltiazem levels.
Rifampin may decrease serum diltiazem levels. Maximal antihypertensive effect seen within 2 wk. Extended-release dosage forms should be swallowed whole and NOT crushed or chewed. Cardizem immediate-release tablets should be swallowed whole because crushing or chewing may alter its pharmacokinetics"

Dobutamine,"Anticonvulsant
************

Continuous IV infusion (all ages): 2.5–15 mcg/kg/min; Max. dose: 40 mcg/kg/min

Contraindicated in idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS). Tachycardia, arrhythmias (PVCs), and hypertension may occasionally occur (especially at higher infusion
rates). Correct hypovolemic states before use. Increases AV conduction, may precipitate ventricular ectopic activity. Dobutamine has been shown to increase cardiac output and systemic pressure in pediatric patients of every age group. However, in premature neonates, dobutamine is less effective than dopamine in  increasing raising systemic BP without causing undue tachycardia, and dobutamine has not been
shown to provide any added benefit when given to such infants already receiving optimal infusions of dopamine. Monitor BP and vital signs. T1/2: 2 min. Peak effects in 10–20 min. Use with linezolid may potentially
increase BP"

May cause hypotension and prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly QTc interval (dose dependent effect). Common side effects include dizziness, headache,
sedation, blurred vision, fever, chills, and sleep disorders. Rare cases of sustained supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, fatal cardiac arrest, and MI have been
reported in children and adolescents. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, or with
concurrent use with other drugs that increase QTc interval (e.g., erythromycin, cisapride). Drug’s  active metabolite (hydrodolasetron) is a substrate for CYP450 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes;
concomitant use of enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) may increase risk for side effects and use of enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease dolasetron’s efficacy. Serotonin syndrome
has been associated with concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g.,
duloxetine, venlafaxine), MAO inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and IV methylene blue. Although no dosage adjustments are necessary, hydrodolasetron’s clearance decreases by 42% with
severe hepatic impairment and 44% with severe renal impairment. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, bradyarrhythmias, or renal impairment.
IV doses may be administered undiluted over 30 sec"
Dopamine,"Sympathomimetic agent
********************
All ages:
      Low dose: 2–5 mcg/kg/min IV; increases renal blood flow; minimal effect on heart rate and  cardiac output
      Intermediate dose: 5–15 mcg/kg/min IV; increases heart rate, cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and to a lesser extent, renal blood flow.
      High dose: >20 mcg/kg/min IV; α-adrenergic effects are prominent; decreases renal perfusion.
      Max. dose recommended: 20–50 mcg/kg/min IV

To prepare infusion: see IV infusions on page i. Do not use in pheochromocytoma, tachyarrhythmia, or hypovolemia. Monitor vital signs and
BP continuously. Correct hypovolemic states. Tachyarrhythmias, ectopic beats, hypertension, vasoconstriction, and vomiting may occur. Use with caution with phenytoin because
hypotension and bradycardia may be exacerbated. Use with linezolid potentially increases BP. Newborn infants may be more sensitive to vasoconstrictive effects of dopamine. Children aged <2 yr
clear dopamine faster and exhibit high variability in neonates. Should be administered through a central line or large vein. Extravasation may cause tissue necrosis; treat with phentolamine. Do not administer into an umbilical arterial catheter"

       Adult: 100 mg PO once daily

Periodontitis:
     Adult: 20 mg BID PO × ≤9 mo

Use with caution in hepatic and renal disease. Generally not recommended for use in children aged <8 yr because of risk for tooth enamel hypoplasia and discoloration. However,
the AAP Redbook recommends doxycycline as the drug of choice for rickettsial disease regardless of age. May cause GI symptoms, photosensitivity, hemolytic anemia, rash, and
hypersensitivity reactions. Increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptom (DRESS),
erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported.

Doxycycline is approved for the treatment of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) in combination with one or two other antimicrobials. If meningitis is suspected, consider using an alternative agent because of
poor CNS penetration. Consider changing to high-dose amoxicillin (25–35 mg/kg/dose TID PO) for penicillin-susceptible strains. See www.bt.cdc.gov for the latest information.
Rifampin, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may increase clearance of doxycycline. Doxycycline may enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin. See Tetracycline for
additional drug/food interactions and remarks. Infuse IV over 1–4 hr. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. For periodontitis, take tablets ≥1 hr prior or 2 hr after meals."

        Abdominal surgery: 40 mg once daily SC × 7–12 days initiated 2 hr prior to surgery.
        Patients at risk due to severe restricted mobility during an acute illness: 40 mg once daily SC × 6–14 days.

Inhibits thrombosis by inactivating factor Xa without significantly affecting bleeding time, platelet function, PT, or aPTT at recommended doses. Dosages of enoxaparin, heparin, or
other LMWHs CANNOT be used interchangeably on a unit-for-unit (or mg-for-mg) basis because of differences in pharmacokinetics and activity. Peak anti–factor Xa LMWH activity
is achieved 4 hr after a dose. Anti–factor Xa LMWH is NOT THE SAME as unfractionated heparin anti–Xa level (used for monitoring heparin therapy).
Contraindicated in major bleeding and drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Use with caution in uncontrolled arterial hypertension, bleeding diathesis, history of recurrent GI ulcers, diabetic
retinopathy, and severe renal dysfunction (reduce dose by increasing the dosage interval from Q12 hr to Q24 hr if GFR is <30 mL/min). Prophylactic use is not recommended in patients with
prostetic heart valves (especially in pregnant women) due to reports of fatalities in patients and fetuses. Concurrent use with spinal or epidural anesthesia, or spinal puncture has resulted in
long-term or permanent paralysis; potential benefits must be weighed against the risks. May cause fever, confusion, edema, nausea, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, hypochromic anemia, and
pain/erythema at injection site. Allergic reactions, headache, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury, and osteoporosis (long-term use) have been reported. Protamine
sulfate is the antidote; 1 mg protamine sulfate neutralizes 1 mg enoxaparin. DVT prophylaxis for patients with epidural catheters/neuraxial anesthesia: If placing needle, hold

High-dose rescue therapy for in-hospital cardiac arrest in children after failure of an initial standard dose has been reported to be of no benefit compared to standard dose (N Engl J Med 2004;350:1722–1730).
May produce arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypertension, headaches, nervousness, nausea, vomiting, and rare cases of stress cardiomyopathy. Necrosis may occur at site of repeated local injection. Rare
cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis, have been reported with IM or deep SC injections.
Concomitant use of noncardiac selective β-blockers, MAO inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, clonidine, or tricyclic antidepressants may enhance epinephrine’s pressor response. Chlorpromazine, diuretics,
nitrates, or α-blockers may reverse the pressor response. Do not use products containing chlorobutanol for ophthalmic use, as it may be harmful to the corneal endothelium.
ETT doses should be diluted with NS to a volume of 3–5 mL before administration. Follow with several positive pressure ventilations.
Hypersensitivity reactions: For bronchial asthma and certain allergic manifestations (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, serum sickness, anaphylactic shock), use epinephrine SC. Patients with anaphylaxis may benefit
from IM administration. The adult IV dose for hypersensitivity reactions or to relieve bronchospasm usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.25 mg injected slowly over 5–10 min Q5–15 min as needed. Neonates may
be given a dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight; for infants, 0.05 mg is an adequate initial dose, and this may be repeated at 20-to 30-min intervals in the management of asthma attacks.
Due to the inconsistent availability of autoinjector products, periodic reeducation of available device may be necessary. See respective autoinjector product for proper dose administration methods
including methods to prevent injury and/or inadvertent dose administration to the individual administering the dose. Accidental injection into the digits, hand, or feet may result in the loss of blood flow
to the affected area. Do not inject into the buttock area."

Adult: Start at 50–100 U/kg/dose 3 times per week.
      Maintenance dose: Dose is individualized to achieve and maintain the lowest Hgb level sufficient to avoid transfusions and not to exceed 11 g/dL.

Anemia in cancer (use until chemotherapy is completed; see remarks for dosage reduction and withholding therapy):
  Initial dose:
      Child (5–18 yr): Start at 600 U/kg (max. dose: 40,000 U) IV once weekly.
       Adult: Start at 150 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per week or 40,000 U SC once every week.
  Increasing doses (if needed):
            Three-times-a-week dosing regimen (adult): If no increase in Hgb > 1 g/dL and Hgb remains < 10 g/dL after initial 4 wk of therapy, increase dosage to 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per week.
            Weekly dosing regimen: If no increase in Hgb > 1 g/dL and Hgb remains < 10 g/dL after initial 4 wk of therapy:

            Child: increase dose to 900 U/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 60,000 U) once weekly.
             Adult: 60,000 U SC once weekly.
For all ages, discontinue use after 8 wk of therapy if transfusions are still required or no hemoglobin response is observed.

AZT-treated HIV patients (Hgb should not exceed 12 g/dL): SC/IV.

Child: Reported dosage range in children (8 mo–17 yr), 50–400 U/kg/dose 2–3 times per wk.

Adult (with serum erythropoietin ≤ 500 milliunits/mL and receiving ≤ 4200 mg AZT per week):
      Start at 100 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk × 8 wk. If response is NOT satisfactory in reducing transfusion requirements or increasing Hgb levels after 8 wk of therapy, dose may be increased by 50–100 U/kg/dose given 3 times per wk and reevaluate every 4–8 wk thereafter. Patients are unlikely to respond to doses > 300 U/kg/dose 3 times a week.

For all ages, withhold therapy if Hgb > 12 g/dL and resume therapy by decreasing dosage by 25% once Hgb falls below 11 g/dL. For adults, discontinue therapy if Hgb does not increase after 8 wk of the 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk dosage.

Anemia of prematurity (many regimens exist):
250 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per wk × 10 doses; alternatively, 200–400 U/kg/dose IV/SC 3–5 times per wk for 2–6 wk (total dose per wk is 600–1400 U/kg). Administer with supplemental iron at 3–6 mg elemental iron/kg/24 hr.
Use the lowest dose to avoid transfusions. Increased risk for death, serious cardiovascular events, and thrombosis/stroke have been reported in patients treated with chronic kidney disease and hemoglobin levels > 11 g/dL. Increased risk for death, shorten survival and/or shorten time to tumor progression/regression, serious cardiovascular events, and thrombosis in various cancer patients, especially with Hgb levels > 12 g/dL have been reported with epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
Evaluate serum iron, ferritin, TIBC before therapy. Iron supplementation recommended during therapy unless iron stores are already in excess. Monitor Hct, BP, clotting times, platelets, BUN, serum creatinine. Peak effect in 2–3 wk.

DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR ANEMIA IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
   Reduce dose by ≥25%: when Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-wk period. Dose reductions can bemade more frequently than once every 4 wk if needed.
   Increase dose by 25%: when Hgb does not increase by 1 g/dL after 4 wk of therapy. Dosage increments should not be made more frequently than once every 4 wk.
   Withholding therapy: when Hgb > 11 g/dL; restart therapy at a 25% lower dose after Hgb decreases to target levels or < 11 g/dL.

Inadequate response after a 12-wk dose escalation: Use minimum effective dosage that will maintain hemoglobin levels to avoid the need for recurrent blood transfusions and evaluate other
causes of anemia. Discontinue use if patient remains transfusion dependent.

DOSAGE REDUCTION ADJUSTMENT/WITHHOLDING THERAPY FOR ANEMIA IN CANCER:
   If Hgb exceeds a level needed to avoid blood transfusion: Withhold dose and resume therapy at a reduced dosage by 25% when Hgb approaches a level where blood transfusions may be needed.
   If Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-wk period or Hgb reaches a level to avoid blood transfusion: Reduce dose by 25%. 

May cause hypertension, seizure, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, edema, dizziness. SC route provides sustained serum levels compared to IV route. For IV administration, infuse over 1–3 min.
Do not use multidose vial preparation for breastfeeding mothers because of concerns for benzyl alcohol.

Avoid use in patients with known QT prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and significant bradycardia), and receiving class IA or class III antiarrhythmic agents, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, or terfenadine. Hypertrophic
pyloric stenosis in neonates receiving prophylactic therapy for pertussis; life-threatening episodes of ventricular tachycardia associated with prolonged QTc interval; and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have been reported. May produce false positive urinary
catecholamines, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, and 17-ketosteroids. GI side effects are common (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps). Cardiac dysrhythmia, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, and hearing loss have been reported. Use with caution in liver disease.
Estolate formulation may cause cholestatic jaundice, although hepatotoxicity is uncommon (2% of reported cases). Inhibits CYP450 1A2, 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May produce elevated digoxin, theophylline, carbamazepine, clozapine, cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone levels. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 30). Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating doses. Oral therapy should replace IV as soon as possible. Give oral doses after meals. Because of different

         <12 yr: Limited data, only one placebo-controlled RCT did not demonstrate efficacy.
         ≥12 yr and adolescent: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed after 3 weeks, dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily.
Adult: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed after 1 week, dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily.

Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD; limited data):
      6–17 yr: In a 10-wk, open-label trial, 28 subjects were given a weekly increasing PO dosage regimen of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/24 hr. Mean dosage of responders with significant improvement at 11.1 ± 6.5 mg/24 hr; 25% of subjects responded at doses < 10 mg/24 hr and 36% responded at doses ≥ 10 mg/24 hr. Seven of the 17 (41%) responders and 25% of all treated subjects could not tolerate the 10 mg/24 hr dose.

Social Anxiety Disorder (limited data):
      10–17 yr: In a 12-week, open-label trial, 20 subjects were given an initial PO dosage of 5 mg once daily × 7 days followed by 10 mg once daily. If needed and tolerated, it was increased by 5 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals up to a maximum of 20 mg/24 hr. Two subjects did not complete the trial due to a lack of efficacy and tolerability; 65% of the remaining subjects met the response criteria with a mean final dose of 13 ± 4.1 mg/24 hr. Common adverse events included somnolence (25%), insomnia (20%), flu symptoms (15%), increased appetite (15%), and decreased appetite (15%).

Increased risk for serotonin syndrome when used with MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of discontinuance), linezolid, or methylene blue; concurrent use considered contraindicated. Do not use with pimozide because of increased QTc interval risk. Use with caution in hepatic or severe renal impairment; dosage adjustment may be needed. Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Diaphoresis, GI discomfort, xerostomia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue are common side effects. Abnormal bleeding, depression, QTc prolongation, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Primarily metabolized by the CYP450 2C19 and 3A4 enzymes and is a weak inhibitor for CYP450 2D6 enzyme. Taking with other medications with QTc prolongation may further increase that risk. Omeprazole may increase the toxicity of escitalopram. Doses may be administered with or without food."

by 33% at the initiation of felbamate, then an additional 33% of original dose at week 2, and continue to reduce other anticonvulsants as clinical indicated at week 3 and beyond.


Drug should be prescribed under strict supervision by a specialist. Contraindicated in blood dyscrasias or hepatic dysfunction (prior or current); and hypersensitivity to meprobamate.
Aplastic anemia and hepatic failure leading to death have been associated with drug. May cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, GI disturbances, gingival hyperplasia, increased liver
enzymes, and bone marrow suppression. Suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported. Obtain serum levels of concurrent anticonvulsants. Monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, CBC
with differential, platelets at baseline and every 1–2 wk. Doses should be decreased by 50% in renally impaired patients. When initiating adjunctive therapy (all ages), doses of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are reduced by 20% to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Further reductions of concomitant AED dosage may be necessary to minimize side
effects caused by drug interactions. When converting to monotherapy, reduce other AEDs by one third at start of felbamate therapy. Then after 2 wk and at the start of increasing the felbamate dosage, reduce other AEDs by an additional one third. At wk 3, continue to reduce other AEDs as clinically indicated. Carbamazepine levels may be decreased; however, phenytoin and valproic acid levels may be
increased. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may increase felbamate clearance; valproic acid may decrease its clearance. Doses can be administered with or without food."
Fentanyl,"Narcotic; analgesic, sedative
*************************
Titrate dose to effect.
Neonate and younger infant:
    Sedation/analgesia: 1–4 mcg/kg/dose IV Q2–4 hr PRN
    Continuous IV infusion: 1–5 mcg/kg/hr; tolerance may develop
Older infant and child:
     Sedation/analgesia: 1–2 mcg/kg/dose IV/IM Q30–60 min PRN
    Continuous IV infusion: 1 mcg/kg/hr; titrate to effect; usual infusion range 1–3 mcg/kg/hr
To prepare infusion, use the following formula:
50×((Desired dose mcg/kg/hr) / (Desired infusion rate mL/hr))x(((Wt (kg)x(mcg Fentanyl))/(50 mL fluid)


Oral, breakthrough cancer pain for opioid-intolerant patients (see remarks):
    Buccal tabs (Fentora; ≥18 yr): Start with 100 mcg by placing tablet in the buccal cavity (above a rear molar between the upper cheek and gum) and letting the tablet dissolve for 15–25 min. A
second 100 mcg dose, if needed, may be administered 30 min after the start of the first dose. If needed, increase dose initially in multiples of 100 mcg tablet when patients require > 1 dose per
breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes. If titration requires > 400 mcg/dose, use 200 mcg tabs.

   Lozenges (≥16 yr): Start with 200 mcg by placing lozenge in the mouth between the cheek and  lower gum. If needed, may repeat dose 15 min after the completion of the first dose (30 min after
start of prior dose). If therapy requires >1 lozenge per episode, consider increasing the dose to the next higher strength. Do not give more than 2 doses for each episode of breakthrough pain and
re-evaluate long-acting opioid therapy if patient requires >4 doses/24 hr. 

     Transdermal (see remarks): Safety has not been established in children <2 yr and should be administered in children ≥2 yr who are opioid tolerant. Use is contraindicated in acute or
postoperative pain in opiate-naïve patients. Opioid-tolerant child receiving at least 60 mg morphine equivalents/24 hr: Use 25 mcg/hr patch Q72 hr. Patch titration should not occur before 3 days of administration of the initial dose or more frequently than every 6 days thereafter.

Intranasal route for acute and preprocedure analgesia (see remarks):
        ≥1 yr–adolescent: 1–2 mcg/kg/dose intranasally (max. dose: 50 mcg) Q1 hr PRN


Use with caution in bradycardia, respiratory depression, and increased intracranial pressure. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 30). Fatalities and life-threatening respiratory
depression have been reported with inappropriate use (overdoses, use in opioid-naïve patients, changing the patch too frequently and exposing the patch to a heat source) of the
transdermal route. Highly lipophilic and may deposit into fat tissue. IV onset of action 1–2 min with peak effects in 10 min. IV duration of action 30–60 min. Give IV dose over 3–5 min. Rapid infusion may cause
respiratory depression and chest wall rigidity. Respiratory depression may persist beyond the period of analgesia. Transdermal onset of action 6–8 hr with a 72-hr duration of action. See Chapter 6 for
pharmacodynamic information with transmucosal and transdermal routes. Buccal tabs and oral lozenges are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in
patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy. Buccal tabs (Fentora) and lozenge (Actiq) dosage forms are available through a restricted distribution program (REMS)
and are NOT bioequivalent (see package insert for conversion). Intranasal route of administration for analgesia has an onset of action at 10–30 min. Pediatric
studies have demonstrated that the intranasal fentanyl is equivalent to and better than morphine (PO/IV/IM) and equivalent to intravenous fentanyl for providing analgesia.
Fentanyl is a substrate for the CYP450 3A4 enzyme. Be aware of medications that inhibit or induce this enzyme, for it may increase or decrease the effects of fentanyl, respectively.

Use with other medications that are known to prolong the QT interval and are metabolized via the CYP450 3A4 enzyme (e.g., erythromycin) is considered contraindicated. May cause
nausea, headache, rash, vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatitis, cholestasis, and diarrhea. Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. Use with caution
in hepatic or renal dysfunction and in patients with proarrhythmic conditions. Inhibits CYP450 2C9/10 and CYP450 3A3/4 (weak inhibitor). May increase effects, toxicity, or levels of
cyclosporine, midazolam, phenytoin, rifabutin, tacrolimus, theophylline, warfarin, oral hypoglycemics, and AZT. Rifampin increases fluconazole metabolism.
Pediatric to adult dose equivalency: every 3 mg/kg pediatric dosage is equal to 100 mg adult dosage. Consider using higher doses in morbidly obese patients. Adjust dose in renal failure.Pregnancy category is “C” for single 150-mg use for vaginal candidiasis but a recent Danish study reports a higher risk of miscarriages during weeks 7–22 of gestation. The FDA is currently
evaluating this and additional data. Pregnancy category is “D” for all other indications (high-dose use during first trimester of pregnancy may result in birth defects)."
Flucytosine,"Antifungal agent

           8–28 days old: 75 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr PO
  >2 kg and ≤60 days old: 75 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr PO

Dosages of 75–100 mg/kg/24 hr have been used in neonates (preterm and term) for candidal meningitis.

Child and adult (monitor serum concentrations): 50–150 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr PO

Monitor CBC, BUN, serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT. Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, CNS disturbance, anemia, leukopenia, and
thrombocytopenia. Use with caution in hepatic and renal impairment and hematologic disorders. Use is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Therapeutic levels: 25–100 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady-state: Obtain peak level 2–4 hr after oral dose following 4 days of continuous dosing. Peak levels of 40–60 mg/L have
been recommended for systemic candidiasis. Maintain trough levels above 25 mg/L. Prolonged levels above 100 mg/L can increase risk for bone marrow suppression. Bone marrow suppression in
immunosuppressed patients can be irreversible and fatal. Flucytosine interferes with creatinine assay tests using the dry-slide enzymatic method (Kodak

Flumazenil,"Benzodiazepine antidote
***********************
Benzodiazepine overdose (IV, see remarks):
     Child (limited data): 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min PRN to a max. total cumulative dose of 1 mg. As an alternative for repeat bolus doses, a continuous infusion of 0.005–0.01 mg/kg/hr has been used.
      Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 30 sec; if needed, give 0.3 mg 30 sec later over 30 sec. Additional doses of 0.5 mg given over 30 sec Q1 min PRN up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg (usual cumulative
dose: 1–3 mg). Patients with only a partial response to 3 mg may require additional slow titration to a total of 5 mg.

Reversal of benzodiazepine sedation (IV):
     Child: Initial dose: 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) given over 15 sec; if needed, after 45 sec, give 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min to a max. total cumulative dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 1 mg,
whichever is lower. Usual total dose: 0.08–1 mg (average 0.65 mg).
     Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 15 sec, if needed, after 45 sec, give 0.2 mg Q1 min to a max. total cumulative dose of 1 mg. Doses may be repeated at 20 min interval (max. dose of 1 mg per 20 min
interval) up to a max. dose of 3 mg in 1 hr.

Does not reverse narcotics. Onset of benzodiazepine reversal occurs in 1–3 min. Reversal effects of flumazenil (T1/2 approximately 1 hr) may wear off sooner than benzodiazepine
effects. If patient does not respond after cumulative 1–3-mg dose, suspect agent other than benzodiazepines. May precipitate seizures, especially in patients taking benzodiazepines for seizure control or in
patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Fear, panic attacks in patients with history of panic disorders have been reported. Use with caution in liver dysfunction; flumazenil’s clearance is significantly reduced. Use normal dose for initial dose and decrease the dosage and frequency for subsequent doses. "
Flunisolide,"Corticosteroid

Depression:
        Child, 8–18 yr: Start at 10–20 mg once daily PO. If started with 10 mg/24 hr, may increase dose to 20 mg/24 hr after 1 wk. Use lower 10 mg/24 hr initial dose for lower-weight children; if needed, increase to 20 mg/24 hr after several weeks.
       Adult: Start at 20 mg once daily PO. May increase after several weeks by 20 mg/24 hr increments to max. dose of 80 mg/24 hr. Doses > 20 mg/24 hr should be divided BID.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder:
    Child, 7–18 yr:
             Lower-weight child: Start at 10 mg once daily PO. May increase after several weeks. Usual dose range: 20–30 mg/24 hr. There is very minimal experience with doses > 20 mg/24 hr and no experience with doses > 60 mg/24 hr.
           Higher-weight child and adolescent: Start at 10 mg once daily PO and increase dose to 20 mg/24 hr after 2 wk. May further increase dose after several weeks. Usual dose range: 20–60 mg/24 hr.

Bulimia:
      Adolescent (PO; limited data): 20 mg QAM × 3 days, then 40 mg QAM × 3 days, then  60 mg QAM.
       Adult: 60 mg QAM PO; it is recommended to titrate up to this dose over several days.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder:
    Adult: Start at 20 mg PO once daily continuously or intermittently (starting 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation through the first full day of menses and repeating with each new
cycle) using the Sarafem product. Max. dose: 80 mg/24 hr. Systematic evaluation has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of 6 mo at a dose of 20 mg/day. Reassess patients periodically to
determine the need for continued treatment.


Contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (e.g., linezolid) due to possibility of seizures, hyperpyrexia, and coma. Use with caution in patients with angle-closure
glaucoma, receiving diuretics, or with liver (reduce dose with cirrhosis) or renal impairment. May increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressants. May cause headache, insomnia,
nervousness, drowsiness, GI disturbance, and weight loss. Increased bleeding diathesis with unaltered prothrombin time may occur with warfarin. Hyponatremia has been reported.
Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
May displace other highly protein-bound drugs. Inhibits CYP450 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4 drug metabolism isoenzymes, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Use with serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans and methylene blue) and drugs that impair serotonin metabolism (MAOIs) may increase the risk for serotonin syndrome. Carefully review the
patients’ medication profile for potential interactions. Delayed-release capsule is currently indicated for depression and is dosed at 90 mg Q7 days. It is unknown if weekly dosing provides the same protection from relapse as does daily dosing. Breast-feeding is not recommended by the manufacturer as adverse events in nursing infants have been reported. Fluoxetine and metabolite are variable and are higher when compared to other SSRIs. Maternal use of SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum may result in more difficult breastfeeding. Infants exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy may also have an increased risk for
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn."

     Max. dose (2 yr–adult): 2 sprays (55 mcg) per nostril/24 hr

Oral inhalation (asthma):
   Fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA and Diskus): Divide all 24-hr doses BID. If desired response is not seen after 2 wk of starting therapy, increase dosage. Then reduce to the lowest effective dose
when asthma symptoms are controlled. Administration of MDI (HFA) with aerochamber enhances drug delivery.

Recommended dosages for asthma (table missing).

Breath-activated aerosol powder inhaler (ArmonAir RespiClick):
   ≥12 yr and adult:
          No prior inhaled corticosteroids: Start with 55 mCg inhaled BID; max. dose: 232 mCg BID
          Prior treatment with inhaled corticosteroids: Start with low (55 mCg), medium (113 mCg), or high (232 mCg) inhaled BID based on the strength of previous inhaled corticosteroid and disease severity; max. dose: 232 mCg BID

Fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta):
     5–11 yr: Inhale 50 mCg once daily
      ≥12 yr and adult: Inhale 100–200 mCg once daily; max. dose: 200 mCg/24 hr.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (limited data; use oral fluticasone propionate HFA dosage form without spacer for PO administration as doses are swallowed):
     Child (1–10 yr): 220 mCg QID × 4 wk, then 220 mCg TID × 3 wk, then 220 mCg BID × 3 wk, and 220 mCg once daily × 2 wk.
     Child ≥11 yr and adolescent: 440 mCg QID × 4 wk, then 440 mCg TID × 3 wk, then 440 mCg BID × 3 wk, and 440 mCg once daily × 2 wk.

Topical (reassess diagnosis if no improvement in 2 wk):
        Cream (see Chapter 8 for topical steroid comparisons):
                   ≥3 mo and adult: Apply thin film to affected areas once daily–BID; then reduce to a less potent topical agent when symptoms are controlled.
       Lotion (see remarks):
                ≥3 mo and adult: Apply thin film to affected areas once daily. Safety of use has not been evaluated longer than 4 wk.
    Ointment:
         Adult: Apply thin film to affected areas BID



Fluticasone propionate and fluticasone furoate do not have equivalent potencies; follow specific dosing regimens for the respective products. Concurrent administration with ritonavir and other CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase fluticasone
levels resulting in Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Use with caution and monitor closely in hepatic impairment. Intranasal: Clear nasal passages prior to use. May cause epistaxis and nasal irritation, which are
usually transient. Taste and smell alterations, rare hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, pruritus, urticaria, wheezing, dyspnea), and nasal septal perforation have been reported in postmarketing
studies. Oral inhalation: Rinse mouth after each use. May cause dysphonia, oral thrush, and dermatitis. Esophageal candidiasis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Compared to
beclomethasone, it has shown to have less of an effect on suppressing linear growth in asthmatic children. Eosinophilic conditions may occur with the withdrawal or decrease of oral corticosteroids
after the initiation of inhaled fluticasone. Topical use: Avoid application/contact to face, eyes, and open skin. Occlusive dressings are not recommended because they may increase local side effects (irritation, folliculitis, acneiform
eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, hypertrichosis, and miliaria). Do not use lotion dosage form with formaldehydehypersensitivity."

Rinse mouth after each use."
Fluvoxamine,"Antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
************************************************
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (use immediate-release tablets unless noted otherwise):
        8–17 yr: Start at 25 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 25 mg/24 hr Q7–14 days (slower titration for minimizing behavioral side effects). Total daily doses >50 mg/24 hr should be divided BID. Female patients may require lower dosages compared to males.
       Max. dose: Child: 8–11 yr: 200 mg/24 hr; and child ≥12–17 yr: 300 mg/24 hr.

Adult: Start at 50 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 50 mg/24 hr Q4–7 days up to a max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr. Total daily doses >100 mg/24 hr should be divided BID.
     Extended-release capsule (adult): Start at 100 mg PO QHS. Dose may be increased by 50 mg/24 hr Q7 days up to a max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr.


Contraindicated with the coadministration of cisapride, pimozide, thioridazine, tizanidine, or MAO inhibitors. Use with caution in hepatic disease (dosage reduction may be
necessary); drug is extensively metabolized by the liver. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose
changes. Inhibits CYP450 1A2, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Dose-related use of thioridazine with fluvoxamine may cause the
prolongation of QT interval and serious arrhythmias. May increase warfarin plasma levels by 98% and prolong PT. May increase toxicity and/or levels of theophylline, caffeine, and tricyclic
antidepressants. Side effects include: headache, insomnia, somnolence, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and dry mouth. Titrate to lowest effective dose. Use a gradual taper when discontinuing therapy to prevent withdrawal
symptoms. Consider the benefits to potential risk for maternal use in breast feeding. Maternal use during pregnancy and postpartum may result in breastfeeding difficulties."
Folic Acid,"Water-soluble vitamin
********************

Folic acid deficiency PO, IM, IV, SC (see following table)
    Folic acid deficiency PO, IM, IV, SC:
            Infant: 0.1 mg/24 hr once daily
           Child <4 yr: 0.1–0.3 mg/24 hr once daily
           Child ≥4 yr and adolescent: 0.1–0.4 mg/24 hr once daily
           Adult: 0.4 mg/24 hr once daily
          Pregnant and lactating women: 0.8 mg/24 hr once daily

Normal levels: see Chapter 28. May mask hematologic effects of vitamin B12 deficiency, but will not prevent progression of neurologic abnormalities. High-dose folic acid may decrease
the absorption of phenytoin. Women of child-bearing age considering pregnancy should take at least 0.4 mg once daily before and during pregnancy to reduce risk of neural tube defects in the fetus. Pregnancy category changes to
“C” if used in doses above the RDA."
Fomepizole,"Antidote for ethylene glycol or methanol toxicity
*******************************************
Child and adult not requiring hemodialysis (IV, all doses administered over 30 min):
       Load: 15 mg/kg/dose × 1
       Maintenance: 10 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr × 4 doses, then 15 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr until ethylene glycol or methanol level decreases to <20 mg/dL and the patient is asymptomatic with normal pH.

Child and adult requiring hemodialysis (IV following the recommended doses at the intervals indicated here. Fomepizole is removed by dialysis. All doses administered IV over 30 min):
        Dosing at the beginning of hemodialysis:
                If < 6 hr since last fomepizole dose: DO NOT administer dose.
                If ≥ 6 hr since last fomepizole dose: Administer next scheduled dose.
      Dosing during hemodialysis: Administer Q4 hr or as continuous infusion of 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr.
      Dosing at the time hemodialysis is completed (based on the time between last dose and end of hemodialysis):
               <1 hr: DO NOT administer dose at end of hemodialysis.
               1–3 hr: Administer 1/2 of next scheduled dose.
               >3 hr: Administer next scheduled dose.
Maintenance dose off hemodialysis: Give next scheduled dose 12 hr from last dose administered.

Works by competitively inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase. Safety and efficacy in pediatrics have not been established. Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to any components or other
pyrazole compounds. Most frequent side effects include headache, nausea, and dizziness.Fomepizole is extensively eliminated by the kidneys (use with caution in renal failure) and removed by hemodialysis.
Drug may solidify at temperatures <25°C (77°F); vial can be liquefied by running it under warm water (efficacy, safety, and stability are not affected). All doses must be diluted with at least 100 mL of D5W or NS to prevent vein irritation."
Formoterol,"β2-adrenergic agonist (long acting)
******************************
≥5 yr and adult:
       Asthma/Bronchodilation (should be used with an inhaled corticosteroid):
            Foradil Aerolizer: 12 mcg Q12 hr; max. dose: 24 mcg/24 hr (12 mcg spaced 12 hr apart)
      Prevention of exercise-induced asthma for patients NOT receiving maintenance long-acting β2-agonists (e.g., formoterol or salmeterol):
         Foradil Aerolizer: 12 mcg 15 min prior to exercise. If needed, an additional dose may be givenonly AFTER 12 hr. Max. dose: 24 mcg/24 hr (12 mcg spaced 12 hr apart). Consider alternative therapy if maximum dosage is not effective.

Fast onset of action (1–3 min) with peak effects in 0.5–1 hr and long duration (up to 12 hr). Although long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists may decrease the frequency of asthma
episodes, they may make asthma episodes more severe when they occur. Use with caution in seizures, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes, ketoacidosis, aneurysm, and pheochromocytoma.
Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, and tremor may occur. Inhalation solution product (Perforomist) is indicated for COPD in adults [20 mcg Q12 hr; max. dose: 40 mcg/24 hr (20 mcg spaced 12 hr apart)].
WARNING: Long-acting β2-agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Only use formoterol as additional therapy for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly requires initiation of treatment with 2 maintenance therapies. Should not be used in conjunction with an inhaled, long-acting β2-agonist and is not a substitute for inhaled or systemic
corticosteroids. See Chapter 24 for recommendations for asthma controller therapy."

HIV positive or exposed with the following infection (IV):
  CMV disease:
        Infant and child:
              Induction: 180 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr in combination with ganciclovir, continue until symptom improvement and convert to maintenance therapy
              Maintenance: 90–120 mg/kg/dose Q24 hr
  CMV retinitis (disseminated disease):
       Infant and child:
            Induction: 180 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr × 14–21 days with or without ganciclovir,
            Maintenance: 90–120 mg/kg/24 hr once daily
      Adolescent and adult:
           Induction: 180 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8–12 hr × 14–21 days
           Maintenance: 90–120 mg/kg/24 hr once daily

       Adolescent and adult: 40 mg/kg/dose Q8–12 hr × 14–21 days or until lesions heal

Varicella zoster unresponsive to acyclovir:
     Infant and child: 40–60 mg/kg/dose Q8 hr × 7–10 days
     Adolescent: 90 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr

Varicella zoster, progressive outer retinal necrosis:
    Infant and child: 90 mg/kg/dose Q12 hr in combination with ganciclovir IV and intravitreal

foscarnet with or without ganciclovir
    Adolescent: 90 mg/kg/dose every 12 hr in combination with IV ganciclovir and intravitreal foscarnet and/or ganciclovir

Intravitreal route for progressive outer retinal necrosis (HIV positive or exposed):
      Child and adolescent: 1.2 mg/0.05 mL per dose twice weekly in combination with IV foscarnet and ganciclovir and/or intravitreal ganciclovir

 Use with caution in patients with renal insufficiency and hypernatremia (large sodium content). Discontinue use in adults if serum Cr ≥ 2.9 mg/dL. 
Adjust dose in renal failure
May cause peripheral neuropathy, seizures, neutropenia, esophageal ulceration, hallucinations, GI disturbance, increased LFTs, hypertension, chest pain, ECG abnormalities, coughing, dyspnea,
bronchospasm, and renal failure (adequate hydration and avoiding nephrotoxic medications may reduce risk). Hypocalcemia (increased risk if given with pentamidine), hypokalemia, and
hypomagnesemia may also occur. Use with ciprofloxacin may increase risk for seizures. Correction of dehydration and adequate hydration reduces the risk for nephrotoxicity; 10–20 mL/kg IV
(max. dose: 1000 mL) of NS or D5W should be administer prior to the first dose and concurrently with subsequent doses. For lower foscarnet dosage regimens of 40–60 mg/kg, use 50% of the
aforementioned hydration recommendations. Actual hydration may need to be reduced when clinically indicated. Oral hydration methods may also be considered in patients who are able to
tolerate. For peripheral line IV administration, the concentration must be diluted to 12 mg/mL in NS or D5W.

Fosphenytoin,"Anticonvulsant
*************
All doses are expressed as phenytoin sodium equivalents (PE) (see remarks for dose administration information):
      Child: See Phenytoin and use the conversion of 1 mg phenytoin = 1 mg PE
      Adult:
           Loading dose:
               Status epilepticus: 15–20 mg PE/kg IV
               Nonemergent loading: 10–20 mg PE/kg IV/IM
               Nonemergent initial maintenance dose: 4–6 mg PE/kg/24 hr IV/IM ÷ Q12–24 hr

All doses should be prescribed and dispensed in terms of mg phenytoin sodium equivalents (PE) to avoid medication errors. Safety in pediatrics has not been fully established.
Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and porphyria (consider amount of phosphate delivered by fosphenytoin in patients with phosphate restrictions). Drug is also
metabolized to liberate small amounts of formaldehyde, which is considered clinically insignificant with short-term use (e.g., 1 wk). Side effects: hypokalemia (with rapid IV administration), slurred
speech, dizziness, ataxia, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, nystagmus, diplopia, and tinnitus. Increased unbound phenytoin concentrations may occur in patients with renal disease or hypoalbuminemia;
measure “free” or “unbound” phenytoin levels in these patients. Abrupt withdrawal may cause status epilepticus. BP and ECG monitoring should be present during
IV loading dose administration. Max. IV infusion rate: 3 mg PE/kg/min up to a max. of 150 mg PE/min. Administer IM via 1 or 2 injection sites and IM route is not recommended in status
epilepticus. Therapeutic levels: 10–20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1–2 mg/L (free only). Recommended peak serum sampling times: 4 hr following an IM dose or 2 hr following an IV dose.
See Phenytoin remarks for drug interactions and additional side effects. Drug is more safely administered via peripheral IV than phenytoin."

IM, IV:
      Neonate (see remarks): 0.5–1 mg/kg/dose Q8–24 hr; max. dose: 2 mg/kg/dose
      Infant and child: 1–2 mg/kg/dose Q6–12 hr
      Adult: 20–40 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 200 mg/dose
PO:
    Neonate: Bioavailability by this route is poor; doses of 1–3 mg/kg/dose once daily to BID have been used
     Infant and child: Start at 2 mg/kg/dose; may increase by 1–2 mg/kg/dose no sooner than 6–8 hr following the previous dose. Max. dose: 6 mg/kg/dose. Dosages have ranged from 1–6 mg/kg/dose Q12–24 hr
     Adult: 20–80 mg/dose Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr

Continuous IV infusion:
     Infant and child: Start at 0.05 mg/kg/hr and titrate to effect
     Adult: Start at 0.1 mg/kg/hr and titrate to effect; max. dose: 0.4 mg/kg/hr

Contraindicated in anuria and hepatic coma. Use with caution in hepatic disease (hepatic encephalopathy has been reported); cirrhotic patients may require higher than usual doses. Ototoxicity may occur in presence of renal disease (especially when used with
aminoglycosides), with rapid IV injection (do not infuse > 4 mg/min in adults), or with hypoproteinemia. May cause hypokalemia, alkalosis, dehydration, hyperuricemia, and
increased calcium excretion. Rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Prolonged use in premature
infants and in children <4 yr may result in nephrocalcinosis. May increase risk for PDA in premature infants during the first week of life.
Furosemide-resistant edema in pediatric patients may benefit with the addition of metolazone. Some of these patients may have an exaggerated response leading to hypovolemia, tachycardia, and
orthostatic hypotension requiring fluid replacement. Severe hypokalemia has been reported with a tendency for diuresis persisting for up to 24 hr after discontinuing metolazone.
Max. rate of intermittent IV dose: 0.5 mg/kg/min. For patients receiving ECMO, do not administer IV doses directly into the ECMO circuit as the medication is absorbed in the circuit, which may result
in diminished effects and the need for higher doses. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in pregnancy-induced hypertension."

     3–4 yr: 40 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID
     ≥5–12 yr: 25–35 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID
Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/24 hr have been well tolerated.
             ≥12 yr and adult (PO, see remarks): Start with 300 mg TID; if needed, increase dose up to 1800 mg/24 hr ÷ TID. Usual effective doses: 900–1800 mg/24 hr ÷ TID. 
            Doses as high as 3.6 g/24 hr have been tolerated.

Neuropathic pain:
   Child (PO; limited data):
          Day 1: 5 mg/kg/dose (max. 300 mg/dose) at bedtime
          Day 2: 5 mg/kg/dose (max. 300 mg/dose) BID
          Day 3: 5 mg/kg/dose (max. 300 mg/dose) TID; then titrate dose to effect. Usual dosage range: 8–35 mg/kg/24 hr
         Maximum daily dose of 3600 mg/24 hr has been suggested but not formally evaluated.
Adult (PO):
    Day 1: 300 mg at bedtime
    Day 2: 300 mg BID
    Day 3: 300 mg TID; then titrate dose to effect. Usual dosage range: 1800–2400 mg/24 hr;max. dose: 3600 mg/24 hr

Postherpetic neuralgia: The above dosage regimen may be titrated up PRN for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg/24 hr ÷ TID (efficacy has been shown from 1800 to 3600 mg/24 hr; however, no additional benefit has been shown for doses >1800 mg/24 hr). The Gralise dosage form is designed for once daily administration with evening meals, whereas the Horizant dosage form is dosed once daily-BID. See specific product information for details. Generally used as adjunctive therapy for partial and secondary generalized seizures and neuropathic pain. Somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus were common when used for seizures (≥12 yr). Viral infections, fever, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility have been
reported in patients aged 3–12 yr receiving other antiepiletics. Dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema are common side effects in adults with postherpetic neuralgia. Suicidal behavior or ideation and multiorgan hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, or DRESS) have been reported. Do not withdraw medication abruptly (withdraw gradually over a minimum of 1 wk). Drug is not metabolized by the liver and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Higher
doses may be required for children aged <5 yr because of faster clearance in this age group. May be taken with or without food. In TID dosing schedule, interval between doses should not exceed 12 hr. Adjust dose in renal impairment"

Herpetic keratitis (ophthalmic gel/drops):
      ≥2 yr and adult: Apply 1 drop on affected eye(s) 5 times a day (~Q3 hr while awake) until corneal ulcer is healed, then 1 drop TID × 7 days
      Limited experience with use in children aged <12 yr. Contraindicated in severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/microliter) or severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25,000/microliter). Use with extreme caution. Reduce dose in renal failure. For oral route of
administration, see Valganciclovir.

Common side effects include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, retinal detachment, and confusion. Drug reactions alleviated with dose reduction or temporary interruption. Ganciclovir may increase didanosine and zidovudine levels, whereas didanosine and zidovudine may decrease ganciclovir levels. Immunosuppressive agents may increase hematologic toxicities. Amphotericin B, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus increase risk for nephrotoxicity. Imipenem/cilastatin may increase risk for seizures.
Minimum dilution is 10 mg/mL and should be infused IV over ≥ 1 hr. IM and SC administration is contraindicated because of a high pH of 11."

Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease (risk of hypotension), renal or hepatic dysfunction, thyrotoxicosis, and epilepsy because the drug lowers the seizure threshold. Extrapyramidal symptoms, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia, ECG changes, nausea, and vomiting can occur. Higher than recommended doses are associated with a higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Leukopenia/neutropenia, including agranulocytosis, and rhabdomyolysis (IM route) have been reported. Drug is metabolized by CYP450 1A2, 2D6, and 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May also inhibit CYP450 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes. Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) may increase levels and effects of haloperidol. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital may decrease levels and effects of haloperidol. Monitor for encephalopathy syndrome when used in combination with lithium. Acutely aggravated patients may require doses as often as Q60 min. Decanoate salt is given every 3–4 wk in doses that are 10–15 times the individual patient’s stabilized oral dose.

*Do not give a loading dose for stroke patients and obtain aPPT 4 hr after the loading dose.

DVT or PE prophylaxis:
     Adult: 5000 U/dose SC Q8–12 hr until ambulatory

Heparin flush (doses should be less than heparinizing dose):
     Younger child: lower doses should be used to avoid systemic heparinization
     Older child and adult:
             Peripheral IV: 1–2 mL of 10 U/mL solution Q4 hr
             Central lines: 2–3 mL of 100 U/mL solution Q24 hr

TPN (central line) and arterial line: add heparin to make a final concentration of 0.5–1 U/mL

Contraindicated in active major bleeding, known or suspected HIT, and concurrent epidural therapy. Use with caution if platelets < 50,000/mm3. Avoid IM injections and other medications affecting platelet function (e.g., NSAIDS and ASA). Toxicities include bleeding, allergy, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. Adjust dose with one of the following laboratory goals: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) anti-Xa level: 0.3–0.7 units/mL aPTT level (reagent specific to reflect anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7 units/mL): 50–80 seconds.
These laboratory measurements are best measured 4–6 hr after initiation or changes in infusion rate. Do not collect blood from the heparinized line or same extremity as site of heparin infusion. If unfractionated heparin anti-Xa or aPTT levels are not available, a ratio of aPPT 1.5–2.5 times the control value has been used in the past. Unfractionated heparin anti-Xa level is NOT THE SAME as low-molecular-weight heparin anti-Xa (used for monitoring low-molecular-weight heparin products
such as enoxaparin). Use preservative-free heparin in neonates. Note: heparin flush doses may alter aPTT in small patients; consider using more dilute heparin in these cases. Use actual body weight when dosing obese patients. Due to recent regulatory changes to the manufacturing process, heparin products may exhibit decreased potency. Antidote: Protamine sulfate (1 mg per 100 U heparin in previous 4 hr). For low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), see Enoxaparin.

Closure of ductus arteriosus:
      <32 wk of gestation and 0.5–1.5 kg (use birth weight to calculate all doses and infuse all doses over 15 min; see remarks): 10 mg/kg/dose IV × 1 followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg/dose each, 24 and 48 hr after the initial dose. Hold second or third dose if urinary output is <0.6 mL/kg/hr; dosing should resume when laboratory studies indicate the return of normal renal function. If the ductus arteriosus fails to close or reopens, a second course of ibuprofen, use of IV indomethacin, or surgery may be necessary.

Contraindicated in active GI bleeding and ulcer disease. Use caution in aspirin hypersensitivity, hepatic/renal insufficiency, heart disease (risk for MI and stroke with prolonged use), dehydration, and in patients receiving anticoagulants. GI distress (lessened
with milk), rashes, ocular problems, hypertension, granulocytopenia, and anemia may occur. Inhibits platelet aggregation. Consumption of more than three alcoholic beverages per day or use with corticosteroids or anticoagulants may increase the risk for GI bleeding. May increase serum levels and effects of digoxin, methotrexate, and lithium. May decrease the effects of antihypertensives, aspirin (antiplatelet effects), furosemide, and thiazide diuretics. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in the 3rd trimester or near delivery. IV USE for analgesia/antipyretic: Hydrate patient well before use. Doses must be diluted to a concentration of ≤4 mg/mL with NS, D5W, or LR and infused over ≥30 min for adults and ≥10 min for children. Most common reported side effects in clinical trials include nausea, flatulence, vomiting, and headache. IV USE for PDA: Contraindicated in untreated infections, congenital heart diseases requiring a patent ductus arteriosus to facilitate satisfactory pulmonary and systemic blood flow, active intracranial or
gastrointestinal bleeds, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, suspected/active NEC, and significant renal impairment. Use with caution in hyperbilirubinemia. Not indicated for IVH prophylaxis. Renal side effects are generally less frequent and severe when compared with IV indomethacin. NEC, GI perforation, and pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Neoprofen doses must be administered within 30 min of preparation and infused intravenously over 15 min."

                8–28 days old: 75 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr IV
Child (4 wk–3 mo): 100 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr IV
Child (>3 mo): 60–100 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr IV; max. dose: 4 g/24 hr

Cystic fibrosis: 90 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr IV; max. dose: 4 g/24 hr
Adult: 1–4 g/24 hr ÷ Q6–8 hr IV; max. dose: 4 g/24 hr or 50 mg/kg/24 hr, whichever is less.

For IV use, give slowly over 30–60 min at a concentration of ≤5 mg/mL to reduce risk for nausea (lowering the rate may reduce severity). Adverse effects: thrombophlebitis, pruritus, urticaria, GI symptoms, seizures, dizziness, hypotension, elevated LFTs, blood dyscrasias, and penicillin allergy. Greater risk for seizures may occur with CNS infections, concomitant use with ganciclovir, higher doses, and renal impairment. CSF penetration is variable but best with inflamed meninges. Not recommended in CNS infections for neonates due to cilastatin accumulation and seizure risk. Do not administer with probenecid (increases imipenem/cilastatin levels) and ganciclovir (increased risk for seizures). May significantly reduce valproic acid levels. Adjust dose in renal insufficiency

Imipramine,"Antidepressant, tricyclic
*********************
Antidepressant:
Child:
        Initial: 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID PO; increase 1–1.5 mg/kg/24 hr Q3–4 days to a max. dose of 5 mg/kg/24 hr
Adolescent:
        Initial: 25–50 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–TID PO; max. dose: 200 mg/24 hr. Dosages exceeding 100 mg/24 hr are generally not necessary
Adult:
     Initial: 75–100 mg/24 hr ÷ TID PO
     Maintenance: 50–300 mg/24 hr QHS PO; max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr

Enuresis (≥6 yr):
   Initial: 10–25 mg QHS PO
   Increment: 10–25 mg/dose at 1- to 2-wk intervals until max. dose for age or desired effect is achieved. Continue × 2–3 mo, then taper slowly

Max. dose:
     6–12 yr: the lesser of 2.5 mg/kg/24 hr or 50 mg/24 hr
     ≥12 yr: 75 mg/24 hr
Augment analgesia for chronic pain:
     Initial: 0.2–0.4 mg/kg/dose QHS PO; increase 50% every 2–3 days to a max. dose of 1–3 mg/kg/dose QHS PO

Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma and patients who used MAO inhibitors within 14 days. See Chapter 2 for management of toxic ingestion. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment. Side effects include sedation, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and arrhythmia. QHS dosing during first weeks of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, and CBC at start of therapy and with dose changes. Tricyclics may cause mania. Therapeutic reference range (sum of imipramine and desipramine) = 150–250 ng/mL. Levels > 1000 ng/mL are toxic; however, toxicity may occur at >300 ng/mL.
Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 5–7 days of continuous therapy. Carbamazepine may reduce imipramine levels, and cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, labetolol, and quinidine may increase imipramine levels. Onset of antidepressant effects: 1–3 wk. Do not discontinue abruptly in patients receiving long-term high dose therapy. Pregnancy category has not been officially assigned by the FDA as congenital abnormalities have been reported in humans with the causal relationship not being established."
Immune Globulin,"Immune globulins
****************
Intravenous (IV) preparations:
       Kawasaki disease (should be initiated within first 10 days of symptoms): 2 g/kg × 1 dose over 8–12-hr infusion. If signs and symptoms persist, consider a second 2 g/kg dose. Some recommend using a different drug brand or lot number for the second dose.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [see RHo(D) immune globulin intravenous for Rh-positive patients]:
       Acute therapy: 400–1000 mg/kg/dose once daily for 2–5 days for a total cumulative dose of 2000 mg/kg
       Maintenance therapy: 400–1000 mg/kg/dose Q3–6 wk based on clinical response

Replacement therapy for antibody-deficient disorders: 
   Start at 400–500 mg/kg/dose Q4 wk and adjust dose based on clinical response and maintain a trough IgG level ≥ 500 mg/dL. 
   For severe hypogammaglobulinemia (<100 mg/dL), patients may benefit with a loading dose of 400 mg/kg/dose once daily × 2, followed by 400–500 mg/kg/dose Q4 wk. 

Pediatric HIV with IgG <400 mg/dL: see replacement therapy for antibody-deficient disorder from above.

Bone marrow transplantation (may decrease risk for infection and death but not acute graft-versus host disease): 
  Start at 400–500 mg/kg/dose to maintain IgG levels at ≥400 mg/dL, resulting in dosage intervals ranging from once weekly to Q3–4 wk. 

General guidelines for administration (see package insert of specific products):
      IV: Begin infusion at 0.01 mL/kg/min, double the rate every 15–30 min up to max. of 0.08 mL/kg/min. If adverse reactions occur, stop infusion until side effects subside and may restart at rate that was previously tolerated.
      IM: Administer in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
            Avoid gluteal region because of risk of injury to sciatic nerve. 
             Consider splitting doses for multiple injection sites to address age specific maximum IM injection volumes. 
     Subcutaneous (SC) preparation:
           Converting to SC route from previous IV dosage for patients receiving IV immune globulin (IVIG) infusions at regular intervals for at least 3 mo (≥2 yr):
                Initial weekly dose (start 1 wk after last IV dose):
                   Dose (g) = 1.53 × Previous IVIG dose in grams (g) ÷ number of weeks between IVIG doses

To convert the above dose in grams to milliliters of drug, multiply dose (g) by 5.
Adjust dose over time by clinical response and serum IgG trough levels. Obtain a previous trough level from IVIG therapy prior to SC conversion, and repeat trough level 2–3 mo after initiating the SC route. 
A goal trough with the SC route of ~290 mg/dL higher than a trough with the IV route has been recommended.

SC administration: Injection sites include the abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and/or lateral hip. Doses may be administered into multiple sites (spaced ≥ 2 inches apart) simultaneously.  (missing table)

Use with caution in patients with an increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., hypercoagulable states, prolonged immobilization, in-dwelling catheters, estrogen use, thrombosis history, cardiovascular risks, and hyperviscosity) or hemolysis (e.g., non-O blood type, associated inflammatory conditions, and receiving high cumulative doses of immune globulins over several days). May cause flushing, chills, fever, headache, and hypotension. Hypersensitivity reaction may occur when IV form is administered rapidly. Maltose containing products may cause an osmotic diuresis. May cause anaphylaxis in IgA-deficient patients due to varied amounts of IgA. Some products are IgA depleted; consult a pharmacist. To decrease risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, IV preparations containing sucrose should not be infused at a rate such that the amount of sucrose exceeds 3 mg/kg/min. SC route provides higher serum trough levels, lower rate of adverse reactions, and shorter administration time when compared with the IV route. Use an adjusted body weight [ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 0.5 (Actual Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight)] for dosing in obese patients has been recommended. Delay immunizations after immune globulin administration (see latest AAP Red Book for details).

Intraventricular hemorrhage prophylaxis: 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV Q24 hr × 3 doses initiated at 6–12 hr of age (give in consultation with a neonatologist).

Contraindicated in active bleeding, coagulation defects, necrotizing enterocolitis, and renal insufficiency (urine output < 0.6 mL/kg/hr). Use with caution in cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, heart disease (risk for MI and stroke with prolonged use), and renal or hepatic impairment. May cause (especially in neonates) decreased urine output, thrombocytopenia, and decreased GI blood flow and may reduce the antihypertensive effects of β-blockers, hydralazine, and ACE inhibitors. Fatal hepatitis has been reported in JRA treatment. Thrombotic events have been observed in adults receiving high doses or prolonged therapy. Monitor renal and hepatic function before and during use. Reduction in cerebral blood flow associated with rapid IV infusion; infuse all IV doses over
20–30 min. Sustained-release capsules are dosed once daily–BID. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used for >48 hr or after 34 wk of gestation or close to delivery."

Iohexol,"Radiopaque agent, contrast media
******************************
Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen:
       Oral (administered prior to IV dose):
                  Child: Mix 20 mL of Omnipaque 350 with 500 mL of noncarbonated beverage of patient’s choice (apple juice works well for younger patients). Administer diluted contrast media PO 30–60 min prior to the IV dose and image acquisition using the following dosage:
         <6 mo: 40–60 mL
          6–18 mo: 120–160 mL
         18 mo–3 yr: 165–240 mL
          3 yr–12 yr: 250–360 mL
          >12 yr: 480–520 mL

Adult: Mix 50 mL of Omnipaque 350 with 1/2 gallon of noncarbonated beverage of patient’s choice. Give 2–4 cups containing 480 mL (16 oz) of the diluted contrast media PO 20–40 min prior to the IV dose and image acquisition.

 IV (administered after PO dose):
         Child: 1–2 mL/kg IV of Omnipaque 240 or Omipaque 300 given 30–60 min after the oral dose. Max. dose: 3 mL/kg.
         Adult: 100–150 mL IV of Omnipaque 300 given 20–40 min after the oral dose.

Use with caution in dehydration, previous allergic reaction to a contrast medium, iodine sensitivity, asthma, hay fever, food allergy, congestive heart failure, severe liver or renal impairment, diabetic nephropathy, multiple myeloma, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and sickle cell disease. Allergic reactions, arrhythmias, hypothyroidism, transient thyroid suppression, and nephrotoxicity have been rarely reported.

Children at higher risk for adverse events with contrast medium administration may include those
having asthma, sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, or serum
creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or those aged <12 mo.
Use NOT recommended with drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., phenothiazines), amiodarone
(increased risk of cardiotoxicity), and metformin (lactic acidosis and acute renal failure).
Many other uses exist; see package insert for additional information. Iohexol is particularly useful
when barium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with suspected bowel perforation or those
where aspiration of contrast medium is of concern. Oral dose is poorly absorbed from the normal GI
tract (0.1%–0.5%); absorption increases with bowel perforation or bowel obstruction.
Concentrations of 302–755 mg iohexol/mL have osmolalities 1.1–3 times that of plasma
(285 mOsm/kg) and CSF (301 mOsm/kg) and may be hypertonic."

Contraindicated in soy or peanut allergy (for aerosol inhaler) and atropine hypersensitivity. Use with caution in narrow-angle glaucoma or bladder neck obstruction, although
ipratropium has fewer anticholinergic systemic effects than atropine. May cause anxiety, dizziness, headache, GI discomfort, and cough with inhaler or nebulized use. Epistaxis,
nasal congestion, and dry mouth/throat have been reported with the nasal spray. Reversible anisocoria may occur with unintentional aerosolization of drug to the eyes, particularly with
mask nebulizers. Proven efficacy of nebulized solution in pediatrics is currently limited to reactive airway disease management in the emergency room and intensive care unit areas.
Combination ipratopium and albuterol products are currently approved for use only in adults and have not been officially studied in children. See albuterol for additional remarks if using the combination
product. Bronchodilation: Onset of action is 1–3 min; peak effects within 1.5–2 hr, and duration of action is 4–6 hr. Shake inhaler well prior to use with spacer. Nebulized solution may be mixed with albuterol (or use the
combination product). Breastfeeding safety extrapolated from safety of atropine."

      Replacement dose is administered by giving an initial dose of 5–7 mg/kg (max. dose:100 mg/24 hr) followed by a maintenance dose of 5–7 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr) Q3–7 days until total iron replacement dose is achieved.

Adult:
   Hemodialysis dependent: 100 mg elemental Fe 1–3 times a wk during dialysis up to a total cumulative dose of 1000 mg. May continue to administer at lowest dose to maintain target Hb, Hct, and iron levels.
   Nonhemodialysis dependent: 200 mg elemental Fe on 5 different days over a 2-wk period (total cumulative dose: 1000 mg).

IV administration: May administer undiluted over 2–5 min. For an infusion, dilute each 100 mg with a max. of 100-mL NS and infuse over at least 15 min.
Oral therapy with iron salts is preferred; injectable routes are painful. Gluconate and sucrose salts may be better tolerated than iron dextran. Adverse effects include hypotension, GI disturbances, fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgias, cramps, and headaches. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for iron dextran and sucrose products; use of test dose prior to first therapeutic dose is recommended. IM administration is only possible with iron dextran salt. Follow infusion recommendations for
specific product. Monitor vital signs during IV infusion. TIBC levels may not be meaningful within 3 wk after dosing. Efficacy and safety of iron sucrose for maintenance therapy have been evaluated in children aged 2 yr and above with CKD and receiving erythropoietin therapy. Common side effects include headache, respiratory tract viral infection, peritonitis, vomiting, pyrexia, dizziness, and cough. Pregnancy category is “B” for ferric gluconate and iron sucrose and “C” for iron dextran."

For INH-resistant TB: Discuss with Health Department or consult ID specialist.

Should not be used alone for treatment. Contraindicated in acute liver disease and previous isoniazid-associated hepatitis. Peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, seizures,encephalopathy, psychosis, and hepatic side effects may occur with higher doses,
especially in combination with rifampin. Severe liver injury has been reported in children and adults treated for latent TB. Follow LFTs monthly. Supplemental pyridoxine (1–2 mg/kg/24 hr) is recommended for prevention of neurological side effects. Toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS have been reported. May cause false-positive urine glucose test.

Inhibits CYP450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A3/4 microsomal enzymes; decrease dose of carbamazepine, diazepam, phenytoin, and prednisone. Prednisone may decrease isoniazid’s effects. Also a substrate and inducer of CYP450 2E1 and may potentiate acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Avoid daily alcohol use to reduce risk of isoniazid-induced hepatitis. May be given IM (same as oral doses) when oral therapy is not possible. Administer oral doses 1 hr prior to and 2 hr after meals. Aluminum salts may decrease absorption. Adjust dose in renal failure"

       Child (>12 yr) and adult: 0.5–2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO × 15–20 wk or until the total cyst count decreases by 70%, whichever comes first. Dosages as low as 0.05 mg/kg/24 hr have been reported to be beneficial.

Contraindicated during pregnancy; known teratogen. Use with caution in females of childbearing age. May cause conjunctivitis, xerosis, pruritus, photosensitivity reactions (avoid exposure to sunlight and use sunscreen), epistaxis, anemia, hyperlipidemia,
pseudotumor cerebri (especially in combination with tetracyclines; avoid this combination), cheilitis, bone pain, muscle aches, skeletal changes, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, elevated ESR, mental depression, aggressive/violent behavior, and psychosis. Serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome and TEN) have been reported. Elevation of liver enzymes may occur during treatment; a dosage reduction or continued treatment may result in normalization. Discontinue use if liver enzymes do not normalize or if hepatitis is suspected.

To avoid additive toxic effects, do not take vitamin A concomitantly. Increases clearance of carbamazepine. Hormonal birth control (oral, injectable, and implantable) failures have been reported with concurrent use. Monitor CBC, ESR, triglycerides, and LFTs."
Itraconazole,"Antifungal agent
***************
Neonate (limited data in full-term neonates treated for tinea capitis): 5 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily × 6 wk
Child (limited data): 3–5 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID; dosages as high as 5–10 mg/kg/24 hr 

have been used for Aspergillus prophylaxis in chronic granulomatous disease. 
Population pharmacokinetic data in pediatric cystic fibrosis and bone marrow transplant patients suggest an oral liquid dosage of 10 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID or oral capsule dosage of 20 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID to be more reliable in achieving trough plasma levels between 500 and 2000 ng/mL. 

Prophylaxis for recurrence of opportunistic disease in HIV:
     Coccidioides spp.: 2–5 mg/kg/dose PO Q12 hr; max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr
     Cryptococcus neoformans: 5 mg/kg/dose PO Q24 hr; max. dose: 200 mg/24 hr
      Histoplasma capsulatum: 5 mg/kg/dose PO Q12 hr; max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr
 
Treatment of opportunistic disease in HIV:
     Candidiasis: 5 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ Q12–24 hr; max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr
     Coccidioides spp.: 5–10 mg/kg/dose PO BID × 3 days, followed by 2–5 mg/kg/dose PO BID; max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr
     Cryptococcus neoformans: 2.5–5 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 200 mg/dose) PO TID × 3 days, followed by 5–10 mg/kg/24 hr (max. dose: 400 mg/24 hr) ÷ once to twice daily for a minimum of 8 wk.

Histoplasma capsulatum: 2–5 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 200 mg/dose) PO TID × 3 days, followed by 2–5 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 200 mg/dose) PO BID × 12 mo.

Adult:
     Blastomycosis and nonmeningeal histoplasmosis: 200 mg PO once daily up to a max. dose of 400 mg/24 hr ÷ BID (max. dose: 200 mg/dose)
     Aspergillosis and severe infections: 600 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID × 3–4 days, followed by 200–400 mg/24 hr ÷ BID; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr ÷ TID.

Oral solution and capsule dosage form should NOT be used interchangeably; oral solution is more bioavailable. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated as effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Contraindicated in CHF and certain interacting drugs (see below). Use with caution in hepatic and/or renal impairment, cardiac dysrhythmias, and azole hypersensitivity. May cause GI symptoms, headaches, rash, liver enzyme elevation, hepatitis, and hypokalemia. Double/blurred vision, dizziness, and tremor have been reported. Like ketoconazole, it inhibits the activity of the CYP450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme. Thus, the coadministration of cisapride, dofetilide, felodipine, methadone, nisoldipine, pimozide, quinidine, 
triazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin, ergot derivatives, and oral midazolam is contraindicated. See remarks in Ketoconazole for additional drug interaction information. Steady-state serum concentrations of >0.25 mg/L itraconazole and >1 mg/L hydroxyitraconazole
(metabolite) have been recommended. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: any time after 2 wk of continuous dosing. Itraconazole has 34–42-hr T1/2. Administer oral solution on an empty stomach, but administer capsules with food. Achlorhydria
reduces absorption of the drug. Do not use oral liquid dosage form in patients with GFR <30 mL/ min because the hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin excipient has reduced clearance with renal failure."
Ketamine,"General anesthetic
*****************

Child (see remarks):
Sedation:
      PO: 5 mg/kg × 1
       IV: 0.25–1 mg/kg

Adult:
    Analgesia with sedation:
         IV (see remarks): 0.2–1 mg/kg
         IM: 0.5–4 mg/kg

Contraindicated in elevated ICP, hypertension, aneurysms, thyrotoxicosis, CHF, angina, and psychotic disorders. May cause hypertension, hypotension, emergence reactions, tachycardia, laryngospasm, respiratory depression, and stimulation of salivary secretions.
Cystitis has been reported with chronic use/abuse. Intravenous use may induce general anesthesia. Coadministration of an anticholinergic agent may be added in situations of clinically significant hypersalivation in patients with impaired ability to mobilize secretions. Benzodiazepine may be used in the presence of a ketamine-associated recovery reaction (prophylaxis use in adults may be beneficial). Ondansetron prophylaxis can slightly reduce vomiting. See Ann Emerg Med. 2001;57:449–461 for additional use information in the emergency department. Drug is a substrate for CYP450 2B6, 2C9 and 3A4 isoenzymes. Consider potential drug interactions with respective enzyme inhibitors and inducers, especially with prolonged use.
Rate of IV infusion should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min and should not be administered over less than 60 s. For additional information including onset and duration of action,. Pregnancy category is considered by many as a “B” despite no formal designation by the FDA."

************************
Oral:
      Child ≥ 2 yr: 3.3–6.6 mg/kg/24 hr once daily
      Adult: 200–400 mg/24 hr once daily
      Max. dose (all ages): 800 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
Topical (see remarks):
        Cream: 1–2 applications/24 hr
        Gel (Xolegel): 1 application once daily
        Shampoo (dandruff): Twice weekly with at least 3 days between applications for up to 8 weeks PRN. Thereafter, intermittently as needed to maintain control.

The systemic dosage form should NOT be first-line treatment for any fungal infection due to concerns of hepatotoxicity and adrenal gland effects (per the FDA). Monitor LFTs in long-term use and adrenal function for patients at risk. Drugs that decrease gastric acidity will decrease absorption. May cause nausea, vomiting, rash, headache, pruritus, and fever. Hepatotoxicity (including fatal cases) has been reported; use in hepatic impairment is contraindicated. High doses may decrease adrenocortical function and serum testosterone levels. Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been reported with all dosage forms. Safety and efficacy with topical use in seborrheic dermatitis for patients aged >12 yr has been established. Avoid topical use on breast or nipples in nursing mothers. Inhibits CYP450 3A4. Contraindicated when used with cisapride, disopyramide, methadone, mefloquine, quinidine, terfinadine, pimozide, or any drug that can prolong the QT interval (because of risk for cardiac arrhythmias) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., simvastatin and lovastatin). Excessive sedation and prolonged hypnotic effects with triazolam use (also contraindicated). May increase levels/effects of phenytoin, digoxin, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, nevirapine, protease inhibitors, and warfarin. Achlorhydria, phenobarbital, rifampin, isoniazid, H2 blockers, antacids, and omeprazole can decrease levels of oral ketoconazole. Administering oral doses with food or acidic beverages and 2 hr prior to antacids will increase absorption.

Lacosamide,"Anticonvulsant
*************
Child (3–18 yr; limited data in 18 patients with refractory partial seizures as adjunctive therapy with moderate response): 
    Start at 1 mg/kg/24 hr (initial max. 100 mg/24 hr) PO ÷ BID. 
    If needed, dose may be increased at weekly intervals by 1 mg/kg/24 hr administered BID up to 10 mg/kg/24 hr. 
    The final doses range from 2 to 10 mg/kg/24 hr. A retrospective trial in 16 patients aged 8–21 yr with focal seizures as adjunctive therapy received an average dose of 4.7 mg/kg/24 hr PO with moderate response.

Phase III trials for lacosamide as an add-on therapy for patients with partial-onset seizures (1 mo–≤18 yr) and tonic clonic seizures are evaluating the following dosage (see www. clinicaltrials.gov for updates):
    <30 kg: 10 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID
    ≥30–<50 kg: 6–8 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID
    ≥50 kg: 150–200 mg PO BID

 ≥17 yr and adult:
        Partial-onset seizures, adjunctive therapy: Start at 50 mg BID IV/PO. If needed, dose may be increased at weekly intervals by 100 mg/24 day administered BID up to the usual maintenance dose of 200–400 mg/24 hr ÷ BID. Use same dose when converting from IV to PO and vice versa. IV use should be considered for temporary use.

Use with caution with known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., second-degree AV block), severe cardiac disease (e.g., MI or heart failure), concomitant use with drugs known to prolong PR interval, and renal (see Chaper 30) and hepatic impairment. Lacosamide
undergoes 95% renal excretion, and a maximum dosage of 300 mg/24 hr is recommended in adults with GFR < 30 mL/min and ESRD. Dose reduction may be necessary with hepatic or renal impairment and concurrent strong inhibitor of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 medication. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment, and an adult max. dose of 300 mg/24 hr is recommended for mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. Most common side effects in adults include diplopia, headache, dizziness, and nausea. Somnolence and irritability were frequently reported in pediatric studies. Patients should be informed about potential dizziness, ataxia, and syncope with use. Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (affecting the skin, kidney, and liver), agranulocytosis, and euphoria (high doses) have been reported. As with other AEDs, monitor for suicidal behavior and ideation. Oral doses may be administered with or without food. IV doses should be administered over 30–60 min. Do not abruptly withdraw therapy (gradually taper) to prevent potential seizures.

      Wk 1 and 2: 25 mg every other day PO.
      Wk 3 and 4: 25 mg once daily PO.
        Usual maintenance dose: 100–400 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID PO titrate to effect. To achieve the usual maintenance dose, increase doses Q1–2 wk by 25–50 mg/24 hr as needed. If adding lamotrigene to valproic acid alone, usual maintenance dose is 100–200 mg/24 hr.

Extended-release dosage form (Lamictal XR):
      ≥13 yr and adult adjunctive therapy (dose increases at week 8 or later should not exceed 100 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals; see remarks):

Converting from a single enzyme-inducing AED to lamotrigine monotherapy for a child ≥ 16 yr and adult (titrate lamotrigine to maintenance dose; then gradually withdraw enzyme-inducing AED by 20% decrements over a 4-wk period; use immediate-release dosage forms):
Wk 1 and 2: 50 mg once daily PO.
Wk 3 and 4: 50 mg BID PO.

*If carbamazepine or other enzyme-inducing drug is discontinued, maintain current lamotrigine dose for 1 week, then decrease daily lamotrigine dose in 100-mg increments at weekly intervals until 200 mg/24 hr. †If valproic acid is discontinued, increase by 50 mg weekly intervals up to 200 mg/24 hr. Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) include carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and other potentially life-threatening rashes have been reported in children (0.3%–0.8%) and adults (0.08%–0.3%) for adjunctive therapy in seizures. Reported rates for adults treated for bipolar/mood disorders as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy are 0.08% and 0.13%, respectively. May cause fatigue, drowsiness, ataxia, rash (especially with valproic acid), headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Diplopia, nystagmus, aseptic meningitis, aggression, and alopecia have also been reported. Use during the first 3 mo of pregnancy may result in a higher chance for cleft lip or cleft palate in the newborn. Suicidal behavior or ideation has been reported. If converting from immediate- to extended-release dosage form, initial dose of extended release should match the total daily dose of the immediate-release dosage and be administered once daily. Adjust dose as needed with the recommended dosage guidelines. Reduce maintenance dose in renal failure. Reduce all doses (initial, escalation, and maintenance) in liver dysfunction defined by the Child-Pugh grading system as follows:
Grade B: moderate dysfunction, decrease dose by ~50%
Grade C: severe dysfunction, decrease dose by ~75%
Withdrawal symptoms may occur if discontinued suddenly. A stepwise dose reduction over ≥2 wk (~50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal.
Acetaminophen, carbamazepine, oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol), phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, and rifampin may decrease levels of lamotrigine. Valproic acid may increase levels.
False positive urine drug screen for phencyclidine (PCP) has been reported.
Safety and efficacy of maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder in 10–17 yr old were not established in an RCT of 301 subjects."

Subequent dosage increase (if needed): May be increased up to 30 mg PO BID after ≥2 wk of therapy without response at initial dose level.
     Alternative weight-based dosing:
            Infant: 1–2 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily
           Child: 0.7–3 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID
           12 yr–adult:
                    GERD: 15 mg PO once daily for up to 8 wk
                    Erosive esophagitis: 30 mg PO once daily × 8–16 wk; maintenance dose: 15 mg PO once daily
                   Duodenal ulcer: 15 mg PO once daily × 4 wk; maintenance dose: 15 mg PO once daily
                  Gastric ulcer and NSAID induced ulcer: 30 mg PO once daily for up to 8 wk
                  Hypersecretory conditions: 60 mg PO once daily; dosage may be increased up to 90 mg PO BID, where doses > 120 mg/24 hr are divided BID

Common side effects include GI discomfort, headache, fatigue, rash, and taste perversion. Hypersensitivity reactions may result in anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, and urticaria. Prolonged use may result in vitamin B12 deficiency
(≥2 yr) or hypomagnesemia (>1 yr). Microscopic colitis resulting in watery diarrhea has been reported, and switching to an alternative proton-pump inhibitor may be beneficial in resolving diarrhea. Drug is a substrate for CYP450 2C19 and 3A3/4. May decrease levels of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, mycophenolate, nelfinavir, and ampicillin esters and increase the levels/effects of methotrexate, tacrolimus, and warfarin. Theophylline clearance may be enhanced. Reduce dose in severe hepatic impairment. May be used in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin for Helicobacter pylori infections. A multicenter, double blind, parallel-group study in infants (1 mo–1 yr) with GERD was no more effective than placebo. Administer all oral doses before meals and 30 min prior to sucralfate. Do not crush or chew the granules (all dosage forms). Capsule may be opened and intact granules may be administered in an acidic beverage or food (e.g., apple or cranberry juice or apple sauce). Do not break or cut the orally disintegrating tablets. Use of oral disintegrating tablets dissolved in water has been reported to clog and block oral syringes and feeding tubes (gastric and jejunostomy). For IV use, use a 1.2-micron inline filter.

     16 yr–adult: Start at 500 mg PO BID; then increase dosage by 500 mg/dose BID every 2 wk as tolerated to reach the target dosage of 1500 mg BID.

Refractory seizures (add-on therapy to various seizure types; data limited to 6 mo–4 yr): 
      Start at 5–10 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID, if needed and tolerated, increase dose by 10 mg/kg/24 hr at weekly intervals up to a max. dose of 60 mg/kg/24 hr.

Do not abruptly withdraw therapy to reduce risk for seizures. Use with caution in renal impairment (reduce dose; see Chapter 30), hemodialysis, and neuropsychiatric conditions. May cause loss of appetite, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, somnolence, agitation, depression, and mood swings. Drowsiness, fatigue, nervousness, and aggressive behavior have been reported in children. Nonpsychotic behavioral symptoms reported in children are approximately 3 times higher than in adults (37.6% vs 13.3%). Suicidal behavior or ideation, serious dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens–Johnson syndrome and TEN), hematologic abnormalities (e.g., anemia and leukopenia), hyponatremia, and hypertension have been reported. Levetiracetam may decrease
carbamazepine’s effects. Ginkgo may decrease levetriacetam’s effects. Drug has excellent PO absorption. For IV use, use similar immediate-release PO dosages only when the oral route of administration is not feasible. Extended-release tablet is designed for once daily administration at similar daily dosage of the immediate-release forms (e.g., 1000 mg once daily of the extended-release tablet is equivalent to 500 mg BID of the immediate-release tablet). Disintegrating tabs (Spritam) may be administered by allowing the tablet to disintegrate in the mouth when taken with a sip of liquid or made into a suspension (see package insert); do not swallow this dosage form whole."

Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to other quinolones. Avoid in patients with history of QTc prolongation or taking QTc prolonging drugs and excessive sunlight exposure. Use with caution in diabetes, seizures, myasthenia gravis, children < 18 yr, and renal impairment (adjust dose, see Chapter 30). May cause GI disturbances, headache, and blurred vision with the ophthalmic solution. Musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, and gait abnormality) may occur. Peripheral neuropathy and uveitis have been reported. Safety in pediatric patients treated for more than 14 days has not been evaluated. Like other quinolones, tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy (risk increases with concurrent corticosteroids). Use with NSAIDs may increase risk for CNS stimulation and seizures. Infuse IV over 1–1.5 hr; avoid IV push or rapid infusion because of risk for hypotension. Do not administer antacids or other divalent salts with or within 2 hr of oral levofloxacin dose; otherwise may be administered with or without food.

     3–6 mo: 8–10 mcg/kg/dose once daily
     6–12 mo: 6–8 mcg/kg/dose once daily
     1–5 yr: 5–6 mcg/kg/dose once daily
     6–12 yr: 4–5 mcg/kg/dose once daily
     >12 yr:
          Incomplete growth and prepuberty: 2–3 mcg/kg/dose once daily
         Complete growth and puberty: 1.7 mcg/kg/dose once daily

Child IM/IV dose: 50%–75% of oral dose once daily

Adult:
    PO: Start with 12.5–25 mcg/dose once daily. Increase by 25–50 mcg/24 hr at intervals of Q2–4 wk until euthyroid. Usual adult dose: 100–200 mcg/24 hr
      IM/IV dose: 50% of oral dose once daily

Myxedema coma or stupor: 200–500 mcg IV × 1, then 100–300 mcg IV once daily; convert to oral therapy once patient is stabilized 

Contraindications include acute MI, thyrotoxicosis, and uncorrected adrenal insufficiency. May cause hyperthyroidism, rash, growth disturbances, hypertension, arrhythmias, diarrhea, and weight loss. Pseudotumor cerebri has been reported in children. Overtreatment may cause craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children. Total replacement dose may be used in children unless there is evidence of cardiac disease; in that case, begin with one-fourth of maintenance dose and increase weekly. Titrate dosage with clinical status and serum T4 and TSH. Increases the effects of warfarin. Phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, iron and calcium supplements, antacids, and orlistat may decrease levothyroxine levels. Tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs may enhance toxic effects. 100 mcg levothyroxine = 65 mg thyroid USP. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach and tablets with a full glass of water. Iron and calcium supplements and antacids may decrease absorption; do not administer within 4 hr of these agents. Excreted in low levels in breast milk; preponderance of evidence suggests no clinically significant effect in infants."

**************************
Child and adult (see remarks):
       Scabies: Apply thin layer of lotion to skin. Bathe and rinse off medication in adults after 8–12 hr; children 6–8 hr. May repeat × 1 in 7 days PRN.
       Pediculosis capitis: Apply 15–30 mL of shampoo, lather for 4–5 min, rinse hair, and comb with fine comb to remove nits. May repeat × 1 in 7 days PRN.
       Pediculosis pubis: May use lotion or shampoo (applied locally) as for scabies and pediculosis capitis (see above).

Contraindicated in premature infants and seizure disorders. Use with caution with drugs that lower seizure threshold. Systemically absorbed. Risk of toxic effects is greater in young children; use other agents (permethrin) in infants, young children (<2 yr), and during pregnancy. Lindane is considered second-line therapy owing to side-effect risk and reports of resistance. May cause a rash; rarely may cause seizures or aplastic anemia. For scabies, change clothing and bed sheets after starting treatment and treat family members. For pediculosis pubis, treat sexual contacts. Avoid contact with face, urethral meatus, damaged skin, or mucous membranes. Do not use any covering that does not breathe (e.g., plastic lining or clothing) over the applied lindane"

Most common side effects include diarrhea, headache, and nausea. Anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia may occur in patients who are at a risk for myelosuppression and who receive regimens > 2 wk. Complete blood count monitoring is
recommended in these individuals. Pseudomembranous colitis and neuropathy (peripheral and optic) have also been reported. CSF penetration is variable in patients with VP shunts. Do not use with SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine and paroxetine), tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, and trazodone; may cause serotonin syndrome. Avoid use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine) and in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, and those taking sympathomimetics or vasopressive agents (may elevate blood pressure). Use with caution when consuming large amounts of foods and beverages containing tyramine; may increase blood pressure. Dosing information in severe hepatic failure and renal impairment with multidoses have not been established. Protect all dosage forms from light and moisture. Oral suspension product must be gently mixed by inverting the bottle 3–5 times prior to each use (do not shake). All oral doses may be administered with or without food."
Lisdexamfetamine,"CNS stimulant
*************
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder:
      Child ≥ 6 yr and adult: Start with 30 mg PO QAM. May increase dose by 10–20 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals if needed up to a max. dose of 70 mg/24 hr.

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine that requires activation by intestinal/hepatic metabolism.

Contraindicated in amphetamine or sympathomimetic hypersensitivity, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, moderate/severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, agitated states, drug/alcohol abuse history, and MAO inhibitors (concurrent or use within 14 days). As with other CNS simulant medications, serious cardiovascular events, including death, have been reported in patients with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, psychiatric conditions, and epilepsy. May cause insomnia, irritability, rash, appetite suppression/weight loss, dizziness, xerostomia, and GI disturbances. Dermatillomania, bruxism, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and TEN have been reported.
Urinary acidifying agents may reduce levels of amphetamines, and urinary alkalinizing agents may increase levels. May increase the effects of TCAs; increase or decrease the effects of guanfacine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital and decrease the effects of adrenergic blockers, antihistamines, and antihypertensives. Norepinephrine may increase the effects of amphetamines. See Dextroamphetamine ± Amphetamine for additional remarks."
Lisinopril,"Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, antihypertensive
*****************************************************
Hypertension (see remarks):
       Child (<6 yr; limited data): Use 6–16 yr dosing below.
       6–16 yr: Start with 0.07–0.1 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; max. initial dose: 5 mg/dose. If needed, titrate dose upward at 1–2-week intervals to doses up to 0.61 mg/kg/24 hr or 40 mg/24 hr (higher doses have not been evaluated).
       Adult: Start with 10 mg PO once daily. If needed, increase dose by 5–10 mg/24 hr at 1–2 week intervals. Usual dosage range: 10–40 mg/24 hr. Max. dose: 80 mg/24 hr.

Use lower initial dose (50% of recommended dose) if using with a diuretic or in the presence of hyponatremia, hypovolemia, severe CHF, or decreased renal function. Contraindicated in hypersensitivity and history of angioedema with other ACE inhibitors. Do not use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. Avoid use with dialysis with high-flux membranes because anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Use with caution in aortic or bilateral renal artery stenosis and hepatic impairment. Side effects include cough, dizziness, headache, hyperkalemia, hypotension (especially with concurrent diuretic or antihypertensive agent use), rash, and GI disturbances. Mood alterations, including depressive symptoms, have been reported. Dual blockade of the renin–angiotensin system with lisinopril and angiotensin receptor antagonist (e.g., losartan) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment. Use in diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents should be
monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of use. NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin) may decrease linsinopril’s effects. Use with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus and everolimus) may increase risk for angioedema. Adjust dose in renal impairment . Onset of action: 1 hr with maximal effect in 6–8 hr. Lisinopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected. Additional indications with limited data in children include proteinuria associated with mild IgA nephropathy and renal protection for diabetes or renal parenchymal disease. "

***************
Child:
       Initial (immediate-release dosage forms): 15–60 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ TID–QID PO. Adjust as needed (weekly) to achieve therapeutic levels.
Adolescent: 600–1800 mg/24 hr ÷ TID–QID PO (divided BID using controlled-/slow-release tablets).
Adult:
     Initial: 300 mg TID PO. Adjust as needed to achieve therapeutic levels. Usual dose is about 300 mg
     TID–QID with immediate-release dosage form. For controlled-/slow-release tablets, 900– 1800 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Max. dose: 2400 mg/24 hr.

Contraindicated in severe cardiovascular (including Brugada syndrome) or renal disease. Decreased sodium intake or increased sodium wasting and significant renal or cardiovascular disease may increase lithium levels, resulting in toxicity. May cause goiter,
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, arrhythmias, or sedation at therapeutic doses. Nephrotic syndrome has been reported. Co-administration with diuretics, metronidazole, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists
(e.g., losartan), or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may increase risk for lithium toxicity. Use with iodine may increase risk for hypothyroidism. If used in combination with haloperidol, closely monitor neurologic toxicities because an encephalopathic syndrome followed by irreversible brain damage has been reported. Therapeutic levels: 0.6–1.5 mEq/L. In either acute or chronic toxicity, confusion and somnolence may be seen at levels of 2–2.5 mEq/L. Seizures or death may occur at levels > 2.5 mEq/L.
Recommended serum sampling: trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose. Steady state is achieved within 4–6 days of continuous dosing. Adjust dose in renal failure"
Lodoxamide,"Antiallergic agent, mast cell stabilizer
*********************************
≥2 yr and adult: Instill 1–2 drops to affected eye(s) QID for up to 3 months.

Transient burning, stinging, or discomfort of the eye and headache are common side effects.

Chronic diarrhea (see remarks):
     Infant–child (limited data): 0.08–0.24 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID–TID; max. dose: 2 mg/dose

Contraindicated in acute dysentery; acute ulcerative colitis; bacterial enterocolitis caused by Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Clostridium difficile; and abdominal pain in the absence of diarrhea. Avoid use in children < 2 yr due to reports of paralytic ileus
associated with abdominal distention. Rare hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock have been reported. May cause nausea, rash, vomiting, constipation, cramps, dry mouth, and CNS depression. Use of higher than recommended dosages via
abuse or misuse can cause serious cardiac events (e.g., Torsades de Pointes, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and QT prolongation). Discontinue use if no clinical improvement is observed within 48 hr. Naloxone may be administered for CNS depression."
Loratadine ± Pseudoephedrine,"Antihistamine, less sedating ± decongestant
***************************************
Loratadine:
       2–5 yr: 5 mg PO once daily

    ≥12 yr and adult (see remarks):

Claritin-D 12 Hour and generics: 1 tablet PO BID
Claritin-D 24 Hour and generics: 1 tablet PO once daily

May cause drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, headache, bronchospasms, palpitations, dermatitis, and dizziness. Has not been implicated in causing cardiac arrhythmias when used with other drugs that are metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes (e.g.,
ketoconazole and erythromycin). May be administered safely in patients who have allergic rhinitis and asthma. In hepatic and renal function impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), prolong loratadine (single agent) dosage interval to every other day. Adjust dose in renal failure . For time-release tablets of the combination product (loratadine and pseudoephedrine), prolong dosage interval in renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) as follows: Claritin-D 12 Hour: 1 tablet PO once daily; Claritin-D 24 Hour: 1 tablet PO every other day. Do not use the combination product in hepatic impairment because drugs cannot be individually titrated. Administer doses on an empty stomach. For use of RediTabs, place tablet on tongue and allow it to disintegrate in the mouth with or without water. For Claritin-D products, also see remarks in Pseudoephedrine."
Lorazepam,"Benzodiazepine anticonvulsant
****************************
Status epilepticus (IV route is preferred but may use IM route if IV is not available):
      Neonate, infant, child, and adolescent: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/dose IV over 2–5 min. May repeat dose in 10–15 min. Max. dose: 4 mg/dose.
      Adult: 4 mg/dose IV given slowly over 2–5 min. May repeat in 10–15 min. Usual total max. dose in 12-hr period is 8 mg.

Anxiolytic/sedation:
     Infant and child: 0.05 mg/kg/dose Q4–8 hr PO/IV; max. dose: 2 mg/dose. May also give IM for preprocedure sedation.
     Adult: 1–10 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID

Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma and severe hypotension. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (glucoronide metabolite clearance is reduced), hepatic insufficiency (may worsen hepatic encephalopahy; decrease dose with severe hepatic impairment),
compromised pulmonary function, and use of CNS depressant medications. May cause respiratory depression, especially in combination with other sedatives. May also cause sedation, dizziness, mild ataxia, mood changes, rash, and GI symptoms. Paradoxical
excitation has been reported in children (10%–30% of patients aged <8 yr). When compared to diazepam for status epilepticus (3 mo–17 yr), lorazepam was found to be more sedating with a longer time to return to baseline mental status.
Significant respiratory depression and/or hypotension has been reported when used in combination with loxapine. Probenecid and valproic acid may increase the effects/toxicity of lorazepam, and oral contraceptive steroids may decrease lorazepam’s effects.
Injectable product may be rectally administered. Benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol may be toxic to newborns at higher doses. Onset of action for sedation: PO, 20–30 min; IM, 30–60 min; IV, 1–5 min. Duration of action: 6–8 hr. Flumazenil is the antidote"
Losartan,"Angiotensin II receptor antagonist
******************************
Hypertension (see remarks):
       6–16 yr: Start with 0.7 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 50 mg/dose) PO once daily. Adjust dose to desired blood pressure response. Max. dose (higher doses have not been evaluated): 1.4 mg/kg/24 hr or 100 mg/24 hr.
        ≥17 yr and adult: Start with 50 mg PO once daily (use lower initial dose of 25 mg PO once daily if patient is receiving diuretics, experiencing intravascular volume depletion, or has hepatic impairment). Usual maintenance dose is 25–100 mg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID.

Use with caution in angioedema (current or past), excessive hypotension (volume depletion), hepatic (use lower starting dose) or renal (contains potassium) impairment, hyperkalemia, renal artery stenosis, and severe CHF. Not recommended in patients < 6 yr or in children with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, owing to lack of data. Discontinue use as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected because injury and death to developing fetus may occur. Pregnancy category is “C” during the first trimester but changes to “D”
for the second and third trimesters. Diarrhea, asthenia, dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension are common. Thrombocytopenia, rhabdomyolysis, hallucinations, and angioedema have been rarely reported. Losartan is a substrate for CYP450 2C9 (major) and 3A4. Fluconazole and cimetidine may increase losartan effects/toxicity. Rifampin, phenobarbital, and indomethacin may decrease its effects. Losartan may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Do not use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes or with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). Dual blockade of the renin–angiotensin system with losartan and ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment."

               Lialda: 2.4–4.8 g once daily PO up to 8 wk
       Maintenance therapy for remission:
              Asacol: 1.6 g/24 hr PO in divided doses
              Lialda: 2.4 g PO once daily
       Suppository: 1000 mg QHS PR × 3–6 wk; retain each dose in the rectum for 1–3 hr or longer, if possible
       Rectal suspension: 60 mL (4 g) QHS × 3–6 wk, retaining each dose for about 8 hr; lie on left side during administration to improve delivery to the sigmoid colon.

Generally not recommended in children < 16 yr with chicken pox or flu-like symptoms (risk of Reye’s syndrome). Contraindicated in active peptic ulcer disease, severe renal failure, and salicylate hypersensitivity. Rectal suspension should not be used in patients with history of sulfite allergy. Use with caution in sulfasalazine hypersensitivity, impaired hepatic, or renal function, pyloric stenosis, and with concurrent thrombolytics. May cause headache, GI discomfort, pancreatitis, pericarditis, and rash. Angioedema, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, DRESS, and fatal infections (e.g., sepsis and pneumonia; discontinue use) have been reported. Safety and efficacy of Asacol in children 5–17 yr for mild/moderate acute ulcerative colitis have been established over a 6-wk period. However, efficacy for maintenance of remission was not established in a 26-wk RCT (potential factors affecting outcome included improper dosage used and premature termination of trial). Safety and efficacy of Canasa suppositories have not been demonstrated for
mild/moderate active ulcerative proctitis in a 6-wk open-label study in 49 patients aged 5–17 yr. Two Delzicol 400 mg capsules have not been shown to be interchangeable or substitutable with one mesalamine 800 delayed-release tablet.
Do not administer with lactulose or other medications that can lower intestinal pH. Oral capsules are designed to release medication throughout the GI tract and oral tablets release medication at the terminal ileus and beyond; 400 mg PO mesalamine is equivalent to 1 g sulfasalazine PO. Tablets should be swallowed whole. May cause a false-positive urinary normetanephrine test. All products have a pregnancy category “B” except for Asacol HD, which has a pregnancy category “C.”"
Metformin,"Antidiabetic, biguanide
*********************
Administer all doses with meals (e.g., BID: morning and evening meals).
         Child (10–16 yr) (see remarks): Start with 500 mg BID; may increase dose weekly by 500 mg/24 hr in two divided doses up to a max. dose of 2000 mg/24 hr.
         Child ≥17 yr and adult (see remarks):
                  500 mg tabs: Start with 500 mg PO BID; may increase dose weekly by 500 mg/24 hr in two divided doses up to a max. dose of 2500 mg/24 hr. 
                       Administer 2500 mg/24 hr doses by dividing daily dose TID with meals.
                 850 mg tabs: Start with 850 mg PO once daily with morning meal; may increase by 850 mg every 2 wk up to a max. dose of 2550 mg/24 hr (first dosage increment: 850 mg PO BID; second dosage increment: 850 mg PO TID).
                 Extended-release tabs: Start with 500 mg PO once daily with evening meal; may increase by 500 mg every wk up to a max. dose of 2000 mg/24 hr (if glycemic control is not achieved at max. dose, divide dose to 1000 mg PO BID). If using Fortamet, max. dose is 2500 mg/24 hr. If a dose > 2000 mg is needed, consider switching to nonextended-release tablets in divided doses and increase dose to a max. dose of 2550 mg/24 hr.

Assess patient’s eGFR prior to initiating therapy. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2), hepatic impairment (increased risk for lactic acidosis), CHF, metabolic acidosis, and during radiology studies using iodinated contrast media. Use with caution when transferring patients from chlorpropamide therapy (potential hypoglycemia risk), excessive alcohol intake, hypoxemia, dehydration, surgical procedures, mild/moderate renal impairment, hepatic disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Fatal lactic acidosis (diarrhea; severe muscle pain, cramping; shallow and fast breathing; and unusual weakness and sleepiness) and decrease in vitamin B12 levels have been reported. May cause GI discomfort (~50% incidence), anorexia, and vomiting. Transient abdominal discomfort or diarrhea have been reported in 40% of pediatric patients. Cimetidine, furosemide, and nifedipine may increase the effects/toxicity of metformin. In addition to monitoring serum glucose and
glycosylated hemoglobin, monitor renal function and hematologic parameters (baseline and annual). Adult patients initiated on 500 mg PO BID may also have their dose increased to 850 mg PO BID after 2 wk.
COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULFONYLUREAS: If patient has not responded to 4 wk of maximum doses of metformin monotherapy, consider gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea with continued maximum metformin dosing (even if failure with sulfonylurea has occurred). Attempt to identify the minimum effective dosage for each drug (metformin and sulfonylurea) because the combination can increase risk for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. If patient does not respond to 1–3 mo of
combination therapy with maximum metformin doses, consider discontinuing combination therapy and initiating insulin therapy. Administer all doses with food.

"
Methadone Hcl,"Narcotic, analgesic
*****************
Analgesia:
       Child: 0.7 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q4–6 hr PO, SC, IM, or IV PRN pain; max. dose: 10 mg/dose.
       Adult: 2.5–10 mg/dose Q3–4 hr PO, SC, IM, or IV PRN pain.
Detoxification or maintenance: See package insert.

Unintentional overdoses have resulted in fatalities and severe adverse events such as respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias. Use with caution in hepatic (avoid in severe cases) and biliary tract impairment. May cause respiratory depression, sedation,
increased intracranial pressure, hypotension, and bradycardia. Average T1/2: children, 19 hr and adults, 35 hr. Duration of action PO is 6–8 hr initially and 22–48 hr after repeated doses. Respiratory effects last longer than analgesia. Accumulation may occur with
continuous use, making it necessary to adjust dose. Nevirapine may decrease serum levels of methadone. Fatalities have been reported with abuse in combination with benzodiazepines. Methadone is a substrate for CYP450 3A3/4, 2D6, and 1A2 and inhibitor
of 2D6. "
Methimazole,"Antithyroid agent
****************
Hyperthyroidism:
   Child:
       Initial: 0.4–0.7 mg/kg/24 hr or 15–20 mg/m2/24 hr PO ÷ Q8 hr
       Maintenance: 1/3–2/3 of initial dose PO ÷ Q8 hr
       Max. dose: 30 mg/24 hr
  Adult:
      Initial: 15–60 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID
      Maintenance: 5–15 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID

Readily crosses placental membranes and distributes into breast milk (maternal dose ≤20 mg/24 hr is considered safe, but there is insufficient data to support safe use with maternal dose > 20 mg/24 hr). Blood dyscrasias, dermatitis, hepatitis, arthralgia, CNS
reactions, pruritis, nephritis, hypoprothrombinemia, agranulocytosis, headache, fever, and hypothyroidism may occur. May increase the effects of oral anticoagulants. When correcting hyperthyroidism, existing β-blocker,
digoxin, and theophylline doses may need to be reduced to avoid potential toxicities. Switch to maintenance dose when patient is euthyroid. Administer all doses with food.

"
Methyldopa,"Central α-adrenergic blocker, antihypertensive
*****************************************
Hypertension:
       Child: 10 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6–12 hr PO; increase PRN Q2 days. Max. dose: 65 mg/kg/24 hr or 3 g/24 hr, whichever is less
       Adult: 250 mg/dose BID-TID PO. Increase PRN Q2 days to max. dose of 3 g/24 hr

Hypertensive crisis:
       Child: 2–4 mg/kg/dose IV, if no response within 4–6 hr, may increase dose to 5–10 mg/kg/dose IV; give doses Q6–8 hr. Max. dose (whichever is less): 65 mg/kg/24 hr or 3 g/24 hr
       Adult: 250–1000 mg IV Q6–8 hr; max. dose: 4 g/24 hr

Contraindicated in pheochromocytoma and active liver disease. Use with caution if patient is receiving haloperidol, propranolol, lithium, or sympathomimetics. Positive Coombs’ test is rarely associated with hemolytic anemia. Fever, leukopenia, sedation, memory impairment, hepatitis, GI disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, black tongue, and gynecomastia may occur. May interfere with lab tests for creatinine, urinary catecholamines, uric acid, and AST. May increase AV blocking effects of β-blockers and antihypertensive effects of other antihypertensives. α2-antagonist antidepressants, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and methylphenidate may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa. Do not use in combination
with MAO inhibitors (may enhance adverse effects of methyldopa). Do not co-administer oral doses with iron; decreases methyldopa absorption. Adjust dose in renal failure . Pregnancy category is “C” for the injectable dosage form and “B” for the oral dosage forms."
Methylene Blue,"Antidote, drug-induced methemoglobinemia and cyanide toxicity
**********************************************************

Methemoglobinemia:
         Child and adult: 1–2 mg/kg/dose or 25–50 mg/m2/dose IV over 5 min. May repeat in 1 hr  if needed

At high doses, may cause methemoglobinemia. Avoid subcutaneous or intrathecal routes of administration. Use with caution in G6PD deficiency or renal insufficiency. May cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, diaphoresis, stained skin, and abdominal pain.
Causes blue-green discoloration of urine and feces. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with the co-administration of selective serotonin reputake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or clomipramine. Use with

       Methylphenidate naive patients: Start with 18 mg PO QAM for children and adolescents and 18–36 mg PO QAM for adults, dosage may be increased at weekly intervals with 18 mg increments up to the following max. dose: 
           6–12 yr: 54 mg/24 hr
          13–17 yr: 72 mg/24 hr not to exceed 2 mg/kg/24 hr

Patients weighing >50 kg: higher max. dose of 108 mg/24 hr may be used
Patients currently receiving methylphenidate: See following table.
RECOMMENDED DOSE CONVERSION FROM METHYLPHENIDATE REGIMENS TO CONCERTA:
Previous Methylphenidate Daily Dose                                                     Recommended Concerta Dose
5 mg PO BID–TID or 20 mg SR PO once daily                                            18 mg PO QAM
10 mg PO BID–TID or 40 mg SR PO once daily                                          36 mg PO QAM
15 mg PO BID–TID or 60 mg SR PO once daily                                          54 mg PO QAM
20 mg PO BID–TID                                                                                                72 mg PO QAM

After a week of receiving the above-recommended Concerta dose, dose may be increased in 18-mg increments at weekly intervals PRN up to a maximum of 54 mg/24 hr for 6–12 yr and 72 mg/24 hr (not to exceed 2 mg/kg/24 hr) for13–17 yr.
Metadate ER (8-hr duration of action): Convert immediate-release tabs when the 8-hr dosage corresponds to the available extended-release tablet size. Usual max. dose: 60 mg/24 hr for children but some patients >50 kg may tolerate doses up to 100 mg/24 hr with increased monitoring.

Transdermal patch (Daytrana): Apply to the hip 2 hr before the effect is needed and remove 9 hr later. Patch may be removed before 9 hr if a shorter duration of effect is desired or if late-day adverse effects appear.
6–17 yr: Start with 10 mg/9 hr patch once daily. Increase dose PRN Q7 days by increasing to the next dosage strength. Higher starting doses have been reported in patients converting from oral dosage forms > 20 mg/24 hr.

Contraindicated in glaucoma, anxiety disorders, motor tics, and Tourette’s syndrome. Medication should generally not be used in children aged <5 yr; diagnosis of ADHD in this age group is extremely difficult and should only be done in consultation with a specialist.
Sudden death (children, adolescents, and adults), stroke (adults), and MI (adults) have been reported in patients with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, psychiatric conditions, and epilepsy. Insomnia, weight loss, anorexia, rash, nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, hyper- or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, restlessness, headaches, fever, tremor, visual disturbances, and thrombocytopenia may occur. Abnormal liver function, cerebral arteritis and/or occlusion, peripheral vasculopathy (including Raynaud’s phenomenon), leukopenia and/or anemia, hypersensitivity reactions, transient depressed mood, paranoia, mania, auditory hallucination, priapism, and scalp hair loss have been reported. Skin irritation, chemical leukoderma, and contact dermatitis has been reported with transdermal route. High doses may slow growth by appetite suppression. GI obstruction has been reported with Concerta. May increase serum concentrations/effects of tricyclic antidepressants, dopamine agonists (e.g., haloperidol), phenytoin, phenobarbital, and warfarin. May decrease the effects of antihypertensive drugs. Effect of methylphenidate may be potentiated by MAO inhibitors; hypertensive crisis may also occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of the MAO inhibitor. Extended/sustained-release dosage forms have either an 8- or 24-hour dosage interval (as stipulated previously). Concerta dosage form delivers 22.2% of its dose as an immediate-release product with the remaining amounts as an extended-release product (e.g., 18-mg strength: 4 mg as immediate release and 14 mg as extended release). Do not consume alcohol with Ritalin LA or Metadate CD dosage forms as it may result in a more rapid release of the drug. Do not expose transdermal application site to external heat sources (e.g., electric blankets, heating pads); this may increase drug release."

Contraindicated in patients with anuria, hepatic coma, or hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or thiazides. Use with caution in severe renal disease, impaired hepatic function, gout, lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. Electrolyte imbalance, GI disturbance, hyperglycemia, marrow suppression, chills, hyperuricemia, chest pain, hepatitis, and rash may occur. Oral suspensions have increased bioavailability; therefore, lower doses may be necessary when using
these dosage forms. More effective than thiazide diuretics in impaired renal function; may be effective in GFRs as low as 20 mL/min. Furosemide-resistant edema in pediatric patients may benefit with the addition of metolazone. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used for pregnancy-induced hypertension."

Patients should not ingest alcohol for 24–48 hr after dose (disulfuram-type reaction). Single-dose oral regimen no longer recommended in bacterial vaginosis due to poor efficacy. May increase levels or toxicity of phenytoin, lithium, and warfarin. Phenobarbital and rifampin may increase metronidazole metabolism. IV infusion must be given slowly over 1 hr. For intravenous use in all ages, some references recommend a 15 mg/kg loading dose. Use of an adjusted body weight (ABW) for dosing [ABW = IBW + (actual or total BW − IBW)] has been recommended for obese patients."

Invasive candidiasis (see remarks):
       Neonate and infant (based on a multidose pharmacokinetic and safety trial in 13 neonates/infants aged >48 hr and <120 days with suspected or invasive candidiasis;minimum of 4–5 days of therapy):
              <1 kg: 10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily; additional data from another multidose trial in 12 preterm neonates (median birth weight: 775 g, 27 wk gestation) suggest 15 mg/kg/dose IV once daily will provide similar AUC drug exposure of approximately 5 mg/kg/dose in adults.
             ≥1 kg: 7–10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily; 10–12 mg/kg/dose IV once daily may be needed for HIV-exposed/infected neonates.

Child and adolescent: 3–4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily; max. dose: 200 mg/dose
Adult: 100–150 mg IV once daily

Esophageal candidiasis (see remarks):
    Child and adult:
            <50 kg: 3–4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily; max. dose: 200 mg/dose.
            ≥50 kg: 150 mg IV once daily; mean duration for successful therapy was 15 days (range: 10–30 days).

Candida prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant:
    Child and adult:
           <50 kg: 1.5 mg/kg/dose IV once daily; max. dose: 50 mg/dose.
           ≥50 kg: 50 mg IV once daily.

Invasive aspergillosis (limited data; see remarks):
      Child and adult:
             <50 kg: 3–4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily; dosages as high as 7.5 mg/kg/24 hr have been tolerated.
             ≥50 kg: 150 mg IV once daily.

Prior hypersensitivity to other echinocandins (anidulafungin, casopofungin) increases risk; anaphylaxis with shock has been reported. Use with caution in hepatic and renal impairment. No dosing adjustments are required based on race or gender or in patients with severe renal dysfunction or mild to moderate hepatic function impairment. Effect of severe hepatic function impairment on micafungin pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated. Higher dosage requirements in premature and young infants may be attributed to faster drug clearance due to lower protein binding. Higher treatment doses in infants and children have been reported at 8.6–12 mg/kg/dose IV once daily. May cause GI disturbances, phlebitis, rash, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test elevation, headache,
fever, and rigor. Anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, TEN, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and hemolysis have been reported. Micafungin is CYP450 3A isoenzyme substrate and weak inhibitor. May increase the effects/toxicity of nifedipine and sirolimus. Safety and efficacy in children ≥ 4 mo have been demonstrated based on well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic/safety studies."

Mometasone is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate; concurrent administration with ketoconazole and other CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors) may increase mometasone levels, resulting in Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Blurred vision, cataracts, and glaucoma have been reported. Use with caution with hepatic impairment; increased drug exposure is possible. 

INTRANASAL: Clear nasal passages and shake nasal spray well before each use. Onset of action for nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 11 hr after the first dose. Nasal burning and irritation may occur. Nasal septal perforation and taste and smell disturbances have been rarely reported. A clinical trial in children 6–17 yr old was not able to demonstrate effectiveness for treating nasal polyps.

ORAL INHALATION (all forms): Rinse mouth after each use. Fever, allergic rhinitis, URI, UTI, GI discomfort, and sore throat have been reported in children. Musculoskeletal pain, oral candidiasis, arthralgia, and fatigue may occur. May potentially worsen tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infection, or ocular herpes simplex. Do not use Asmanex Twisthaler if allergic to milk proteins. The Twisthaler dosage form requires a minimum 30–60 L/min inspiratory flow rate to assure proper dose delivery. Breast-feeding information is currently unknown, but most experts consider use of inhaled corticosteroids acceptable.

MOMETASONE + FOMOTEROL (Dulera): Common side effects include nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and headache. Angioedema, anaphylaxis, and arrhythmias have been reported. See Formoterol for additional remarks.

TOPICAL USE: HPA axis suppression and skin atrophy have been reported with cream and ointment use in infants 6–23 mo. Avoid application/contact to face, eyes, underarms, groin, and mucous membranes. Occlusive dressings and use in diaper dermatitis are not recommended."

            Delayed-release tabs (Myfortic): 720–1080 mg PO BID

Check specific transplantation protocol for specific dosage. Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug for mycophenolic acid. Owing to differences in absorption, the delayed-release tablets should not be interchanged with other oral dosage forms on an equivalent
mg-to-mg basis. Increases risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and increased risk of congenital malformations (especially external ear and facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, and esophagus).
Common side effects may include headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, anemia, fever, opportunistic infections, and sepsis. May increase the risk for bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections and lymphomas or other malignancies. GI bleeds and increased risk for rejection in heart transplant patients switched from calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and CellCept to sirolimus and CellCept have been reported. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported. Use with caution in patients with active GI disease or renal impairment (GFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) outside of the immediate posttransplant period. In adults with renal impairment, avoid doses > 2 g/24 hr and observe carefully. Dose should be interrupted or reduced in the presence of neutropenia (ANC < 1.3 × 103/µL). No dose adjustment is needed for patients experiencing delayed graft function postoperatively. Drug interactions: (1) Displacement of phenytoin or theophylline from protein-binding sites will decrease total serum levels and increase free serum levels of these drugs. Salicylates displace mycophenolate to increase free levels of mycophenolate. (2) Competition for renal tubular secretion results in increased serum levels of acyclovir, ganciclovir, probenecid, and mycophenolate (when any of these are used together). (3) Avoid live and live attenuated vaccines (including influenza); decreases vaccine effectiveness. (4) Proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, and telmisartan may reduce mycophenolate levels. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach. Infuse intravenous doses over 2 hr. Oral suspension may be administered via NG tube with a minimum size of 8 French "

Adult: 0.4–2 mg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2–3 min. Use 0.1- to 0.2-mg increments in opiatedependent patients.

Intranasal route for opiate intoxication:
    Child, adolescent, and adult: 4 mg (0.1 mL) of nasal liquid (Narcan) into one nostril, PRN Q2–3 min in alternate nostrils. Alternatively for adolescents and adults, the 2 mg/2 mL intravenous syringe dosage form with nasal adaptor may be used by administering 1 mg (1 mL) per nostril.

Opiate induced pruritis (limited data): 0.25–2 mcg/kg/hr IV; a dose finding study in 59 children suggests a minimum dose of 1 mcg/kg/hr when used as prophylactic therapy. Doses ≥ 3 mcg/kg/hr increases the risk for reduced pain control.
Short duration of action may necessitate multiple doses. For severe intoxication, doses of 0.2 mg/kg may be required. If no response is achieved after a cumulative dose of 10 mg reevaluate diagnosis. In the nonarrest situation, use the lowest effective dose (may start at 0.001 mg/kg/dose). See Chapter 6 for additional information. Will produce narcotic withdrawal syndrome in patients with chronic dependence. Use with caution in patients with chronic cardiac disease. Abrupt reversal of narcotic depression may result in nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and tremulousness. IV administration is preferred.

Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Contraindicated in moderate/ severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) and postexposure (occupational or nonoccupational) prophylactic regimens. Most frequent side effects include skin rash (may be life-threatening, including Stevens–Johnson Syndrome and DRESS; permanently discontinue and never restart), fever, abnormal liver function tests, headache, and nausea. Discontinue therapy if any of the following occurs: severe rash and rash with fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, or muscle aches. Permanently discontinue and do not restart therapy if symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations, or hypersensitivity reactions occur. Life-threatening hepatotoxicity has been reported primarily during the first 12 wk of therapy. Patients with increased serum transaminase or a history of hepatitis B or C infection prior to nevirapine are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity. Women, including pregnant women, with CD4 counts > 250 cells/mm3 or men with CD4 counts > 400 cells/mm3 are at risk for hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver function tests (obtain transaminases immediately after development of hepatitis signs/symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or rash) and CBCs. Hypophosphatemia has been
reported Nevirapine induces the drug metabolizing isoenzyme CYP450 3A4 to cause an autoinduction of its own metabolism within the first 2–4 wk of therapy and has the potential to interact with many drugs. Carefully review the patient’s drug profile for other drug interactions each time nevirapine is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing nevirapine. Doses can be administered with food and concurrently with didanosine."

   Oral:
           Immediate release: 20 mg PO TID, dose may be increased after 3 days to 40 mg PO TID if needed.
          Sustained release: 30 mg PO BID, dose may be increased after 3 days to 60 mg PO BID if needed.
          Continuous IV infusion: Start at 5 mg/hr, increase dose as needed by 2.5 mg/hr Q5–15 min up to a max. dose of 15 mg/hr. Following attainment of desired BP, decrease infusion to 3 mg/hr and adjust rate as needed to maintain desired response.

Reported use in children has been limited to a small number of preterm infants, infants, and children. Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis. Avoid systemic hypotension in patients following an acute cerebral infarct or hemorrhage. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction by carefully titrating dose. The drug undergoes significant first-pass metabolism through the liver and is excreted in the urine (60%). Use caution when converting to another dosage form; they are NOT equivalent on a milligram-per-
milligram basis. May cause headache, dizziness, asthenia, peripheral edema, and GI symptoms. Nicardipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A and inhibitor of CYP 450 2 C9/19. Cimetidine increases the effects/toxicity of nicardipine. Nicardipine may increase effect/toxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. See Nifedipine for additional drug and food interactions. Onset of action for orally administered drug is 20 min with peak effects in 0.5 to 2 hr. Onset of action of intravenously administered drug is 1 min. Duration of action following a single IV or PO dose is 3 hr. To reduce the risk for venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment with IV administration, do not use small veins (e.g., dorsum of hand or wrist). Avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. For additional information,"

Use of immediate-release dosage form in children is controversial and has been abandoned by some. Use with caution in children with acute CNS injury due to increased risk for stroke, seizure, hepatic impairment, and altered level of consciousness. To prevent rapid decrease in blood pressure in children, an initial dose of ≤0.25 mg/kg is recommended. Use with caution in patients with CHF, aortic stenosis, GI obstruction/narrowing (bezoar formation), and cirrhosis (reduced drug clearance). May cause severe hypotension, peripheral edema, flushing tachycardia, headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, and syncope. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been reported. Although overall use in adults has been abandoned, the immediate-release dosage form is
contraindicated in adults with severe obstructive coronary artery disease or recent MI, and hypertensive emergencies. Nifedipine is a substrate for CYP450 3A3/4 and 3A5–7. Do not administer with grapefruit juice; may increase bioavailability and effects. Itraconazole and ketoconazole may increase nifedipine levels/ effects. CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) may reduce nifedipine’s effects. Nifedipine may increase phenytoin, cyclosporine, and digoxin levels. For

Contraindicated in glaucoma, severe anemia, concurrent phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil), and concurrent guanylate cyclase stimulator (e.g., riociguat). In small doses (1–2 mcg/kg/min), acts mainly on systemic veins and decreases preload. At 3–5 mcg/kg/min, acts on systemic arterioles to decrease resistance. May cause headache, flushing, GI upset, blurred vision, and methemoglobinemia. Use with caution in severe renal impairment, increased ICP, and hepatic failure. IV nitroglycerin may antagonize
anticoagulant effect of heparin. Decrease dose gradually in patients receiving drug for prolonged periods to avoid withdrawal reaction. Must use polypropylene infusion sets to avoid adsorption of drug to plastic tubing. Use in
heparinized patients may result in a decrease of PTT with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Onset (duration) of action: IV, 1–2 min (3–5 min); sublingual, 1–3 min (30–60 min); PO sustained release, 40 min (4–8 hr); topical ointment, 20–60 min (2–12 hr); and transdermal patch, 40–60 min (18–24 hr)."

         Child 6–12 yr (limited data): Start at 2.5 mg PO once daily × 7 days, then increase dose in 2.5 or 5 mg increments Q7 days to a target dose of 10 mg once daily. Suggested max. dose: 20 mg/24 hr.
         Adolescent (see remarks): Start at 2.5 or 5 mg PO once daily × 7 days, then increase dose in 2.5 or 5 mg increments Q7 days to a target dose of 10 mg once daily. Doses >20 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.
         Adult: Start at 10 or 15 mg PO once daily (use 10 mg if used with lithium or valproate). If needed, increase or decrease dose by 5 mg daily at intervals not < 24 hr. Maintenance dosage range: 5–20 mg/24 hr. Doses >20 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.

Schizophrenia:
     Adolescent (see remarks): Start with 2.5 or 5 mg PO once daily, increase dose in 2.5 or 5 mg increments Q7 days to the target dose of 10 mg once daily. Doses >20 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.
     Adult: Start with 5 or 10 mg PO once daily (use 5 mg for individuals who are debilitated, predisposed to hypotension, or may exhibit slower metabolism) with a target dose of 10 mg once daily within 5–7 days. If needed, increase or decrease dose by 5 mg daily at weekly intervals. Usual dosage range: 10–15 mg once daily. Additional clinical assessment is recommended for doses >10 mg/24 hr. Doses >20 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.

IM DOSING:
     Short acting for acute agitation associated with bipolar I or schizophrenia:
             Child and adolescent (limited retrospective data in 15 children and 35 adolescents): ≤12 yr:
                      5 mg and adolescent (13–17 yr): 10 mg. Dosing frequencies and max. doses were not reported.
             Adult: 10 mg (5 or 7.5 mg may be for individuals who are debilitated, predisposed to hypotension, or may exhibit slower metabolism). If needed, additional doses × 2 may be given in 2–4 hr intervals. Recommended max. dose is 30 mg/24 hr (10 mg × 3  separated 2–4-hr apart); safety of doses >30 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.

Long-acting (Zyprexa Relprevv) for schizophrenia (adult): see remarks and package insert for specific dosage based on established oral dosage.
Use with caution in cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hypotensive conditions, diabetes/hyperglycemia, elevated serum lipids and cholesterol, paralytic ileus, hepatic impairment, seizure disorders, narrow angle glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy.
Medication exhibits anticholinergic effects Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, hyperprolactinemia, appetite simulation, weight gain (greater in adolescents than in adults;
monitoring is recommended), hypertriglyceridemia, constipation, xerostomia, akathisia, asthenia, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, and personality disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, dystonia, cognitive and motor impairment, tardive dyskinesia (irreversible with cumulative high doses), neutropenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, suicidal intent, acute pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, increases in LFTs (ALT, AST, GGT), and hyperthermia have been reported.
Olanzapine is a major substrate for CYP450 1A2 and minor substrate for 2D6. It also is a weak inhibitor to CYP450 1A2, 2C9/19. Do not use in combination with benzodiazepines or opiates due to increased risk for sedation and cardiopulmonary depression and with anticholinergic agents (e.g., azelastine, glycopyrrolate) as olanzapine may enhance anticholinergic effects. Use with QTc prolonging medications may further increase the risk for QTc prolongation. Metoclopramide may
enhance neurological side effects of olanazpine. T1/2: 37 hr for children and 21–54 hr for adults via PO route. Short-acting IM T1/2 in adults is similar to PO route but long-acting IM T1/2 is ~30 days in adults.
Maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia has not been systematically evaluated in adolescents. Therefore, it is recommended to utilize the lowest dose to maintain efficacy and periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment for this age group.All oral dosages may be taken with or without food. For orally disintegrating tabs, place tablet in mouth immediately after removing from foil pack (peel off foil and do not push tablet through foil) and allow the tablet to dissolve in saliva and swallow with or without liquids. Zyrexa Relprevv (long acting IM injection): postinjection delirium and sedation syndrome have been reported with this dosage form. Patients must be observed at a health care provider at a health care facility for at least 3 hr after administration. The FDA REMS program requires prescribers, "

**********************
Infant and child:
         Esophagitis, GERD, or ulcers: Start at 1 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID (max. dose: 20 mg/24 hr). Reported effective range: 0.2–3.5 mg/kg/24 hr. Children 1–6 yr may require higher doses due to enhanced drug clearance. Alternative dosing by weight category:
                 3–<5 kg: 2.5 mg PO once daily
                5–<10 kg: 5 mg PO once daily
               10–<20 kg: 10 mg PO once daily
               ≥20 kg: 20 mg PO once daily

Adult:
    Duodenal ulcer or GERD: 20 mg/dose PO once daily × 4–8 wk; may give up to 12 wk for erosive esophagitis.
    Gastric ulcer: 40 mg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–BID × 4–8 wk.
    Pathological hypersecretory conditions: Start with 60 mg/24 hr PO once daily. If needed, dose may be increased up to 120 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID. Daily doses >80 mg should be administered in divided doses.

Common side effects: headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, acute interstitial nephritis, and vitamin B12 deficiency (with prolonged use) have been reported. Has been associated with increased risk for Clostridium Difficile–associated diarrhea. Drug induces CYP450 1A2 (decreases theophylline levels) and is also a substrate and inhibitor of CYP2C19. Increases T1/2 of citalopram, diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin. May decrease the effects of itraconazole, ketoconazole, clopidogrel, iron salts, and ampicillin esters. St. Johns’s Wort and rifampin may decrease omeprazole effects. May be used in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin for Helicobacter pylori infections. Omeprazole may interfere with diagnostic tests for
neuroendocrine tumors; discontinue use at least 14 days prior to testing. Bioavailability may be increased with hepatic dysfunction or in patients of Asian descent. Safety and efficacy for GERD in children <1 mo have not been established.
Administer all doses before meals. Administer 30 min prior to sucralfate. Capsules contain enteric-coated granules to ensure bioavailability. Do not chew or crush capsule. For doses unable to be divided by 10 mg, capsule may be opened and intact pellets may be administered in an acidic beverage (e.g., apple juice, cranberry juice) or apple sauce. The extemporaneously compounded oral suspension product may be less bioavailable due to the loss of the enteric coating."

     Highly emetogenic drugs: 0.15 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 16 mg/dose) 30 min before, 4 and 8 hr after emetogenic drugs. Then 0.15 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 16 mg/dose) Q4 hr PRN.
     Preventing nausea and vomiting associated with surgery (additional doses for controlling nausea and vomiting may not provide any benefits):
        IV/IM (administered prior to anesthesia over 2–5 min):
                Child (2–12 yr):
                          <40 kg: 0.1 mg/kg/dose × 1
                          ≥40 kg: 4 mg × 1
                Adult: 4 mg × 1
      PO:
               Adult: 16 mg × 1, 1 hr prior to induction of anesthesia

Preventing nausea and vomiting associated with radiation therapy:
        Child: use above dosage for preventing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and give initial dose 1–2 hr prior to radiation
        Adult: 
Total body irradiation: 8 mg PO 1–2 hr prior to radiation once daily 
Single high-dose fraction radiation to abdomen: 8 mg PO 1–2 hr prior to radiation with subsequent doses Q8 hr after first dose × 1–2 days after completion of radiation
Daily fractionated radiation to abdomen: 8 mg PO 1–2 hr prior to radiation with subsequent doses Q8 hr after first dose for each day radiation is given

Vomiting in acute gastroenteritis (PO route is preferred, use IV when PO is not possible):
        PO (6 mo–10 yr and ≥8 kg; use oral disintegrating tablet):
                 8–15 kg: 2 mg × 1
                 >15 and ≤30 kg: 4 mg × 1
                 >30 kg: 8 mg × 1
         IV (≥1 mo): 0.15–0.3 mg/kg/dose × 1; max. dose: 4 mg/dose

Avoid use in congenital long QTc syndrome. Bronchospasm; tachycardia; hypokalemia; seizures; headaches; lightheadedness; constipation; diarrhea; and transient increases in AST, ALT, and bilirubin may occur. Transient blindness (resolution within a few min up to
48 hr), arthralgia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, TEN, hepatic dysfunction, and rare/transient ECG changes (including QTc interval prolongation) have been reported. Data limited for use in children <3 yr.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, or bradyarrhythmias. Drug clearance is higher for surgical and cancer patients <18 yr when compared to adults. Clearance is slower in children aged 1–4 mo than in those aged >4–24 mo.
Ondansetron is a substrate for CYP450 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A3/4 drug-metabolizing enzymes. It is likely that the inhibition/loss of one of the previously listed enzymes will be compensated by others and may result in insignificant changes to ondansetron’s elimination. Ondansetron’s elimination may be affected by CYP450 enzyme inducers. Follow theophylline, phenytoin, or warfarin levels closely if used in combination. Use with apomorphine may result in profound hypotension and loss
of consciousness and is contraindicated. To administer the oral film dosage form, place film on top of tongue, allow it to dissolve completely in 4–20 s, and swallow with or without liquid"

     >40 kg: 75 mg PO once daily
     ≥13 yr and adult: 75 mg PO once daily for a minimum of 7 days and up to 6 wk; initiate therapy within 2 days of exposure

Currently indicated for the treatment of influenza A and B strains. Use in children <1 yr has not been recommended due to concerns of excessive CNS penetration and fatalities in 7-day-old rats. Nausea and vomiting generally occur within the first 2 days and are the most common adverse effects. Insomnia, vertigo, seizures, hypothermia, neuropsychiatric events (may result in fatal outcomes), arrhythmias, rash, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Reduce dosage treatment dose if GFR is 10–30 mL/min to 75 mg PO once daily × 5 days for adults. 
PROPHYLACTIC USE: Oseltamivir is not a substitute for annual flu vaccination. Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated for ≤6 wk of therapy; duration of protection lasts for as long as dosing is continued. Adjust prophylaxis dose if GFR is 10–30 mL/min by extending the dosage interval to once every other day. Probenecid increases oseltamivir levels. Oseltamivir decreases the efficacy of the nasal influenza vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist); avoid administration of vaccine within 2 wk
before or 48 hrs after oseltamivir administration, unless medically indicated.Dosage adjustments in hepatic impairment, severe renal disease and dialysis have not been established for either treatment or prophylactic use. The safety and efficacy of repeated treatment or prophylaxis courses have not been evaluated. Doses may be administered with or without food"

    Conversion to monotherapy: Start with 600 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID and simultaneously initiate dosage reduction of concomitant AEDs. 
    Dose may be increased at weekly intervals, as clinically indicated, by a maximum of 600 mg/24 hr to achieve a dose of 2400 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID.

Concomitant AEDs should be terminated gradually over approximately 3–6 wk.
Initiation of monotherapy: Start with 600 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Then increase by 300 mg/24 hr every 3 days up to 1200 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID.

EXTENDED-RELEASE TABS (Oxtellar XR; see remarks):
Child 6–17 yr:
         Adjunctive therapy: Start with 8–10 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily up to a max. dose of 600 mg/24 hr.
         Then gradually increase at weekly intervals in 8–10-mg/kg/24 hr increments (max. dosage increment: 600 mg) to the following maintenance doses:
             20–29 kg: 900 mg PO once daily
            29.1–39 kg: 1200 mg PO once daily
           ≥39.1 kg: 1800 mg PO once daily

Adult:
Adjunctive therapy: Start with 600 mg PO once daily (consider using 900 mg if receiving concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs). 
Then gradually increase at weekly intervals in 600-mg/24 hr increments to a maintenance dose of 1200–2400 mg once daily.

Clinically significant hyponatremia may occur; generally seen within the first 3 mo of therapy. May also cause headache, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus urticaria, diplopia, abnormal gait, and GI discomfort. About 25%–30% of patients with
carbamazepine hypersensitivity will experience a cross reaction with oxcarbazepine. Serious dermatological reactions (Stevens–Johnson and TEN), multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow depression, osteoporosis, pancreatitis, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema, and suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported. Inhibits CYP450 2C19 and induces CYP450 3A4/5 drug-metabolizing enzymes. Carbamazepine, cyclosporine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid, and verapamil may decrease oxcarbazepine levels. Oxcarbazepine may increase phenobarbital and phenytoin levels. Oxcarbazepine can decrease the effects of oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, felodipine, and lamotrigine. If GFR < 30 mL/min, adjust dosage by administering 50% of the normal starting dose (max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr) followed by a slower than normal increase in dose if necessary. No dosage adjustment is required in mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment due to lack of information. Extended- and immediate-release products are not bioequivalent as higher doses of the extendedrelease product may be necessary. Doses may be administered with or without food"

      Extended release (Ditropan XL): 5–10 mg/dose once daily PO, adjust in 5 mg weekly increments, if needed, up to a max. dose of 30 mg/dose once daily PO

Transdermal system: 1 patch (3.9 mg/24 hr) every 3–4 days (twice weekly)

Use with caution in hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, IBD, or cardiovascular disease. Anticholinergic side effects may occur, including drowsiness, confusion, and hallucinations. Contraindicated in glaucoma, GI obstruction, megacolon, myasthenia gravis, severe colitis, hypovolemia, and GU obstruction. Memory impairment, angioedema, and QT-interval prolongation have been reported. Oxybutynin is a CYP450 3A4 substrate; inhibitors and inducers of CYP450 3A4 may increase and decrease the effects of oxybutynin, respectively. May antagonize the effects of metoclopramide. Dosage adjustments for the extended-release dosage form are at weekly intervals. Do not crush, chew, or divide the extended-release tablets. Apply transdermal system on dry intact skin on the abdomen, hip, or buttock by rotating the site and avoiding same-site application within 7 days

Oxycodone,"Narcotic, analgesic
***************
Opioid-naïve doses based on oxycodone hydrochloride salt:
      Child: 0.05–0.15 mg/kg/dose Q4–6 hr PRN up to 5 mg/dose PO
      Adolescent (≥50 kg) and adult: 5–10 mg Q4–6 hr PRN PO; see remarks for use of controlledrelease tablets

Abuse potential, CNS and respiratory depression, increased ICP, histamine release, constipation, and GI distress may occur. Use with caution in severe renal impairment (increases T1/2) and mild/moderate hepatic dysfunction (using 1/3 to 1/2 of usual dose has
been recommended). Naloxone is the antidote. See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing. Check dosages of acetaminophen or aspirin when using combination products (e.g., Percocet, Percodan). Oxycodone is metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 (major) and 2D6 (minor)
isoenzyme. When using controlled-release tablets (e.g., Oxycontin), determine patient’s total 24-hr requirements and divide by 2 to administer on a Q12-hr dosing interval. Oxycontin 80-mg tablet is USED ONLY for opioid tolerant patients; this strength can cause fatal respiratory depression in opioid-naïve patients. Controlled-release dosage form should not be used as a PRN analgesic and must be swallowed whole. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used for prolonged periods or in high doses at term"

Contraindicated in patients on MAO inhibitor therapy. Rebound nasal congestion may occur with excessive use (>3 days) via the nasal route. Systemic absorption may occur. Headache, insomnia, hypertension, transient burning, stinging, dryness, nasal mucosa
ulceration, and sneezing have occurred. Accidental ingestion in children <5 yr has been reported and required hospitalization for adverse events (nausea, vomiting, lethargy, tachycardia, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, sedation, mydriasis, stupor, hypothermia, drooling and coma)"
Palivizumab,"Monoclonal antibody
*****************
RSV prophylaxis during RSV season for the following age and clinical criteria (see latest edition of Red Book for most recent indications).
Following recommendations are from Pediatrics. 2014;134(2):415-420.

Candidates for recommended use:
    <12 mo of age (one of the following): Born at ≤28 wk gestation; OR With chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity (<32 wk gestation requiring >21% oxygen for at least 28 days after birth); OR With hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
    <24 mo of age with CLD requiring medical therapy (e.g., supplemental oxygen, bronchodilator, diuretics, or chronic steroids) within 6 mo prior to start of RSV season Candidates for consideration:
    <12 mo of age (one of the following): With congenital airway abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders that decrease ability to manage airway secretions; OR With cystic fibrosis with clinical evidence of CLD and/or nutritional compromise
    ≤24 mo of age (one of the following): With cystic fibrosis with severe lung disease (previous pulmonary exacerbation in first year of life or abnormal chest x-ray) or weight for length < the 10th percentile; OR Profoundly immunocompromised; OR Undergoing cardiac transplantation during RSV season

DOSE:
     ≤24 months old: 15 mg/kg/dose IM Q monthly just prior to and during the RSV season. Max. of five doses per RSV season is recommended by the AAP.  
      Therapy should be discontinued if child experiences breakthrough RSV hospitalization.

RSV season is typically November through April in the northern hemisphere but may begin earlier or persist later in certain communities. IM is currently the only route of administration, so use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation
disorder. The following adverse effects have been reported at slightly higher incidences when compared with placebo: rhinitis, rash, pain, increased liver enzymes, pharyngitis, cough, wheeze, diarrhea, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and anemia. Rare acute hypersensitivity reactions have been reported (first or subsequent doses). Does not interfere with the response to routine childhood vaccines. May interfere with immunologicbased RSV diagnostic tests (some antigen detection–based assays and viral culture assays) but not with reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. Palivizumab is currently indicated for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants only. Efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated for treatment of RSV. Each dose should be administered IM in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. It is recommended to divide doses with total injection volumes > 1 mL. Avoid injection in the gluteal muscle because of risk of damage to the sciatic nerve"
Pancrelipase/Pancreatic Enzymes,"Pancreatic enzyme
***************
Initial doses (actual requirements are patient specific):
        Enteric-coated microspheres and microtabs:
                Infant: 2000–4000 U lipase per 120 mL (formula or breast milk)
               Child < 4 yr: 1000 U lipase/kg/meal
               Child ≥ 4 yr and adult: 500 U lipase/kg/meal
                     Max. dose (Child–adult): 2500 U lipase/kg/meal, or 10,000 U lipase/kg/24 hr, or 4000 U lipase/g fat/24 hr

Total daily dose should include approximately three meals and two to three snacks per day. Snack doses are approximately half of meal doses, depending on the amount of fat and food consumed. Maycult GI bleeding, allergic reactions to porcine proteins, hyperuricemia, and hyperuricosuria with high doses. Dose should be titrated to eliminate diarrhea and to minimize steatorrhea. Do not chew microspheres or microtabs. Concurrent administration with H2 antagonists or gastric acid pump inhibitors may enhance enzyme efficacy. Doses higher than 6000 U lipase/kg/meal have been associated with colonic strictures in children <12 yr. Powder dosage form is not preferred owing to potential GI mucosal ulceration. Avoid use of generic pancreatic enzyme products because they have been associated with treatment failures. Products not approved by the FDA are no longer allowed to be distributed in the United States Patients requiring enzyme supplementation, who receive enteral feeding via a feeding tube, may
alternatively use a digestive enzyme cartridge (RELiZORB)."
Pancuronium Bromide,"Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent
**************************************
Intermittent dosing (see remarks):
      Neonate:
                 Initial: 0.02 mg/kg/dose IV
                 Maintenance: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/dose IV Q0.5–4 hr PRN
       1 mo–adult:
                 Initial: 0.04–0.1 mg/kg/dose IV
                 Maintenance: 0.015–0.1 mg/kg/dose IV Q30–60 min

Continuous IV infusion (see remarks):
      Neonate: 0.02–0.04 mg/kg/hr
      Child: 0.03–1 mg/kg/hr
      Adolescent and adult: 0.02–0.04 mg/kg/hr

Onset of action is 1–2 min. May cause tachycardia, salivation, and wheezing. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported; crossreactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents has been reported.

Drug effects may be accentuated by hypothermia, acidosis, neonatal age, decreased renal function, halothane, succinylcholine, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, clindamycin, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Drug effects may be antagonized by alkalosis, hypercalcemia, peripheral neuropathies, diabetes mellitus, demyelinating lesions, carbamazepine, phenytoin, theophylline, anticholinesterases (e.g., neostigmine and pyridostigmine), and azathioprine. For obese patients, use of lean body weight for dose calculation has been recommended to prevent intense block of long duration and possible overdose. Antidote is neostigmine (with atropine or glycopyrrolate). Avoid use in severe renal impairment (<10 mL/min). Patients with cirrhosis may require a high initial dose to achieve adequate relaxation, but muscle paralysis will be prolonged"
Pantoprazole,"Gastric acid pump inhibitor
**********************
Child (see remarks):
        GERD (limited data):
                      Infant and <5 yr: 1.2 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily. Note: Pantoprazole did not significantly improve GERD symptom scores in an open-label trial in 128 infants (1–11 mo) receiving 1.2 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily × 4 wk, followed by a 4-wk, double-blinded,  placebo-controlled withdrawal phase.
                    ≥5 yr and adolescent: 20 or 40 mg PO once daily.

GERD with erosive esophagitis:
         1–5 yr (limited data): 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily all improved GERD symptoms in an 8–wk, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for 60 subjects with GERD and histologic/erosive esophagitis
         ≥5 yr (up to 8-wk therapy):
                  15–<40 kg: 20 mg PO once daily
                  ≥40 kg: 40 mg PO once daily

IV (data limited to pharmacokinetic trials): Some doses ranging from 0.32 to 1.88 mg/kg/dose have been reported from three separate trials (N = 31; 0.01–16.4 yr). Patients with Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) cleared the drug more slowly, resulting in higher T1/2 and AUC, than those without SIRS. Despite limited data, 1–2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12–24 hr have been used. Additional studies are needed.

Adult:
      GERD with erosive esophagitis:
      PO: 40 mg once daily × 8–16 wk
       IV: 40 mg once daily × 7–10 days

Peptic ulcer: 40–80 mg PO once daily × 4–8 wk

Hypersecretory conditions:
        PO: 40 mg BID; dose may be increased as needed up to a max. dose of 240 mg/24 hr.
        IV: 80 mg Q12 hr; dose may be increased as needed to Q8 hr (max. dose: 240 mg/24 hr).
       Therapy > 7 days at 240 mg/24 hr has not been evaluated.

Convert from IV to PO therapy as soon as patient is able to tolerate PO. Common side effects include diarrhea and headache. May cause transient elevation in LFTs. Like other PPIs, may increase risk for C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Hypomagnesemia has been reported with long-term use. Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria), agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and taste disorders have been reported. Drug is a substrate for CYP450 2C19 (major), 2D6 (minor), and 3A3/4 (minor) isoenzymes. May decrease the absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, iron salts, and ampicillin esters. May increase the effect/toxicity of methotrexate. Children aged 1–2 yr have demonstrated more rapid clearance of pantoprazole in pharmacokinetic studies; this age group may require higher doses. All oral doses may be taken with or without food. Do not crush or chew tablets. The extemporaneously compounded oral suspension may be less bioavailable owing to the loss of the enteric coating. Granules for delayed-release oral suspension product may be mixed with 5 mL apple juice (administer immediately followed by rinsing container with more apple juice) or sprinkled on 1 teaspoonful of apple sauce (administer within 10 min); see package insert for NG administration. For IV infusion, doses may be administered over 15 min at a concentration of 0.4–0.8 mg/mL or over 2 min at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. Midazolam and zinc are not compatible with the IV dosage form. Parenteral routes other than IV are not recommended"

Contraindicated in patients with heart block or sinus bradycardia and those who are receiving delavirdine (decrease virologic response). IM administration is not recommended because of erratic absorption and pain at injection site; consider fosphenytoin. Side effects include gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, dermatitis, blood dyscrasia, ataxia, lupus-like and Stevens–Johnson syndromes, lymphadenopathy, liver damage, and nystagmus. Suicidal behavior or ideation and multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS) have been reported. An increased risk for serious skin reactions (e.g., TEN and Stevens–Johnson syndrome) may occur in patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele. Many drug interactions: levels may be increased by cimetidine, chloramphenicol, INH, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, etc. Levels may be decreased by some antineoplastic agents. Phenytoin induces hepatic microsomal enzymes (CYP450 1A2, 2C8/9/19, and 3A3/4), leading to decreased effectiveness of oral contraceptives, fosamprenavir (used without ritonavir), quinidine, valproic
acid, theophylline, and other substrates to the previously listed CYP450 hepatic enzymes. May increase levels of amprenavir when administered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir. May cause resistance to neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium). Suggested dosing intervals for specific oral dosage forms: extended-release caps (once daily–BID); chewable tablets, and oral suspension (TID). Oral absorption reduced in neonates. T1/2 is variable (7–42 hr) and dose-dependent. Drug is highly protein-bound; free fraction of drug will be increased in patients with hypoalbuminemia. For seizure disorders, therapeutic levels: 10–20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1–2 mg/L (free only). Monitor free phenytoin levels in hypoalbuminemia or renal insufficiency. Recommended serum sampling times: trough level (PO/IV) within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose; peak or postload level (IV) 1 hr after the end of IV infusion. Steady state is usually achieved after 5–10 days of continuous dosing. For routine monitoring, measure trough. IV push/infusion rate: Not to exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min in neonates, or 1 mg/kg/min infants, children, and adults with max. dose of 50 mg/min; may cause cardiovascular collapse. Consider fosphenytoin in situations of tenuous IV access and risk for extravasation"

Piperacillin with Tazobactam,"Antibiotic, penicillin (extended spectrum with β-lactamase inhibitor)
*******************************************************

All doses based on piperacillin component.
     Neonate: 100 mg/kg/dose IV at the following intervals:
            <1 kg:
                ≤14 days old: Q12 hr
                15–28 days old: Q8 hr
           ≥1 kg:
               ≤7 days old: Q12 hr
               8–28 days old: Q8 hr

Severe infections (IV; shortening the dosing interval to Q6 hr and lengthening the dose administration time (see remarks) may enhance the pharmacodynamic properties):
      <2 mo (currently undefined by manufacturer; extrapolated from piperacillin dosing): 80 mg/kg/dose Q6 hr; some recommend using 80 mg/kg/dose Q4 hr
      2–9 mo: 80 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr
      >9 mo: 100 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr
              Max. dose (all ages): 16 g/24 hr

Appendicitis or peritonitis (IV route for 7–10 days; dosing interval may be shorten to Q6 hr to enhance pharmacodynamic properties):
       2–9 mo: 80 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr
       >9 mo–adolescent:
             ≤40 kg: 100 mg/kg/dose (max. 3000 mg/dose) Q6–8 hr
              >40 kg: 3 g/dose Q6 hr
              Max. dose (all ages): 16 g/24 hr
     Adult:
             Intra-abdominal or soft tissue infections: 3 g IV Q6 hr

Nosocomial pneumonia: 4 g IV Q6 hr

Cystic fibrosis (antipseudomonal): 350–600 mg/kg/24 hr IV ÷ Q4–6 hr; max. dose: 24 g/24 hr

Tazobactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor, thus extending the spectrum of piperacillin. Like other penicillins, CSF penetration occurs only with inflamed meninges. GI disturbances, pruritus, rash, and headaches are common. Abnormal platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens–Johnson, DRESS, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and TEN) have been reported. Cystic Fibrosis patients have an increased risk for fever and rash. Increase incidence of acute kidney injury has been reported when used in combination with IV vancomycin. Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly with high doses of heparin, warfarin, or other drugs affecting blood coagulation or thrombocyte function. May falsely
decrease aminoglycoside serum levels if the drugs are infused close to one another; allow a minimum of 2 hr between infusions to prevent this interaction. May prolong the neuromuscular blockade effects of vecuronium. Prolonging the dose administration time to 4 hr will maximize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties by prolonging the time of drug concentration above the MIC. Adjust dose in renal impairment"

increase risk for bone marrow suppression. Aurothioglucose, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole may increase risk for blood dyscrasias. Administer doses with meals. Most cases of acquired toxoplasmosis do not require specific antimicrobial therapy"
Quetiapine,"Antipsychotic, second generation
***************************
Bipolar Mania (continue therapy at lowest dose to maintain efficacy and periodically assess maintenance treatment needs; PO):
    Immediate-release dosage forms: (table missing)


Schizophrenia (continue therapy at lowest dose to maintain efficacy and periodically assess maintenance treatment needs; PO):
     Immediate-release dosage forms:(table missing)

Avoid use in patients with history of cardiac arrhythmias or prolonged QTc syndrome, concurrent medications that can prolong the QTc interval, and alcohol use. Use with caution in hypovolemia and diabetes mellitus.
Suicidal ideation/behavior or worsening depression may occur especially in children and young adults during the first few months of therapy or during dosage changes. Common side effects in children include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactenemia, and
significant weight gain. Other common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal pain, GI disturbances, increase appetite, xerostomia, increase serum transaminases, EPS, headache, dizziness, agitation, and fatigue. Anaphylactic reactions, DRESS, TEN, SIADH, cardiomyopathy, priapism, DKA, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, agranulocystosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, cataracts, hypothyroidism, neuroleptic
malignant syndrome, and seizures have been reported. Do not abruptly discontinue medication as acute withdrawal symptoms may occur. Dosage adjustment in hepatic impairment may be necessary as it is primarily heptically metabolized. Quetiapine is a
major substrate for CYP450 3A4 and minor substrate for 2D6. Opiods and other CNS depressants may enhance CNS depressant effects. Carbamazepine may decrease the effects of quetiapine.Quetiapine may decrease dopamine agonist effects (e.g., antiparkinson agents) but may enhance the anticholinergic and QTc prolongation effects to those medications pocessing these risks. Alwayscheck for drug interactions as effects can be mild to severe. Nonextended-release dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-release tabs must be swallowed whole and administered preferably in the evening without food (a light meal of≤300 calories is allowed). May convert patients from immediate-release to extended-release tabs at the equivalent total daily dose and administer once daily; individual dosage adjustments may be necessary."

   Adult:
          As sulfate: 100–600 mg/dose PO Q 4–6 hr. Begin at 200 mg/dose and titrate to desired effect.
         As gluconate: 324–972 mg PO Q 8–12 hr.

Malaria:
    Child and adult (give intravenously as gluconate; see remarks):
        Loading dose: 10 mg/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 600 mg) over 1–2 hr followed by maintenance dose.

Omit or decrease load if patient has received quinine or mefloquine. Maintenance dose: 0.02 mg/kg/min IV as continuous infusion until oral therapy can be initiated. If more than 48 hr of intravenous therapy is required, reduce dose by 30%–50%.
Test dose is given to assess for idiosyncratic reaction to quinidine. Toxicity indicated by increase of QRS interval by ≥0.02 sec (skip dose or stop drug). May cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, hypotension, tinnitus, TTP, rash, heart block and blood dyscrasias. When
used alone, may cause 1:1 conduction in atrial flutter leading to ventricular fibrillation. Patients may develop idiosyncratic ventricular tachycardia with low levels, especially when therapy is being initiated. Quinidine is a substrate of CYP 450 3A3/4 and 3A5–7 enzymes, and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 enzymes. Can cause increase in digoxin levels. Quinidine potentiates the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents, beta blockers, anticholinergics, and warfarin. Amiodarone, antacids, delavirdine, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, saquinavir, ritonavir, verapamil, or cimetidine may enhance the drug’s effect. Barbiturates, phenytoin, cholinergic drugs, nifedipine, sucralfate, or rifampin may reduce quinidine’s effect. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (15%–25% of drug is
eliminated unchanged in the urine), myocardial depression, sick sinus syndrome, G6PD deficiency, and hepatic dysfunction. Therapeutic levels (antiarrhythmic): 3–7 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling times at steady state: trough level obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 1–2 days of continuous dosing (steady state). MALARIA USE: Continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and serum glucose is recommended, especially in pregnant women and young children.

ORAL RIBAVIRIN: Contraindicated in pregnancy, significant or unstable cardiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic decompensation (Child-Pugh score > 6; class B or C), hemoglobinopathies, and creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min. Use with caution in
preexisiting cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, and sarcoidosis. Anemia (most common), insomnia, depression, irritability, and suicidal behavior (higher in adolescent and pediatric patients) have been reported with the oral route Tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and homicidal ideation have been reported in combination with interferon. Pancytopenia has been reported in combination with interferon and azathoprine. Increased risk for hepatic decompensation with cirrotic chronic hepatitis C patients treated with α-interferons or with HIV co-infection receiving HAART and interferon alfa-2a. Growth inhibition (delays in weight and height gain) was observed in children (5–17 yr old) receiving combination therapy for up to 48 weeks.

May decrease the effects of zidovudine and stavudine and increase risk for lactic acidosis with nucleoside analogues. Reduce or discontinue dosage for toxicity as follows (for Copegus, see package insert):
Patient with no cardiac disease:
  Hgb < 10 g/dL and ≥8.5 g/dL:
             Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily
             Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM
            (tablets)
  Hgb < 8.5 g/dL: Discontinue therapy permanently

Patient with cardiac disease:
        ≥2 mg/dL decrease in Hgb during any 4-wk period during therapy:
               Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily (monitor weekly)
               Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM (tablets)
      Hgb < 12 g/dL after 4 wk of reduced dose: Discontinue therapy permanently

INHALED RIBAVIRIN: Use of ribavirin for RSV is controversial and not routinely indicated. Aerosol therapy may be considered for selected infants and young children at high risk for serious RSV disease (see most recent edition of the AAP Redbook). Most effective if begun early in course of RSV infection; generally in the first 3 days. May cause worsening respiratory distress, rash, conjunctivitis, mild bronchospasm, hypotension, anemia, and cardiac arrest. Avoid unnecessary occupational exposure to ribavirin due to its teratogenic effects. Drug can precipitate in the respiratory equipment"

Never use as monotherapy except when used for prophylaxis. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection should NOT be treated with rifampin and pyrazinamide because of the risk of severe liver injury. Use is NOT recommended in porphyria. Use with caution in diabetes May cause GI irritation, allergy, headache, fatigue, ataxia, muscle weakness, confusion, fever, hepatitis, transient LFT abnormalities, blood dyscrasias, interstitial nephritis, and elevated BUN and uric acid. Causes red discoloration of body secretions such as urine, saliva, and tears (which can permanently stain contact lenses). Induces hepatic enzymes (CYP450 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4), which may decrease plasma concentration of digoxin, corticosteroids, buspirone, benzodiazepines, fentanyl, calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, itraconazole, ketoconazole, oral anticoagulants, barbiturates, and theophylline. May reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and antiretroviral agents (protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Hepatotoxicity is a concern when used in combination with pyrazinamide and ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (use is contraindicated). Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 30).

                 Usual effective dose: 2–8 mg/24 hr. Doses above 16 mg/24 hr have not been evaluated.
       IM: Start with 25 mg Q2 wk; if no response, dose may be increased to 37.5 mg or 50 mg at 4-wk intervals. Max. IM dose: 50 mg Q2 wk. PO risperidone should also be administered with the initial IM dose and continued × 3 wk and discontinued to provide adequate plasma concentrations during the initial IM dosing.

Use with caution in cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, renal or hepatic impairment (dose reduction necessary), hypothermia or hyperthermia, seizures, breast cancer or other prolactin dependent tumors, and dysphagia. Common side effects include abdominal pain
and other GI disturbances, arthralgia, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence (use QHS dosing), EPS, cough, fever, pharyngitis, rash, rhinitis, sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, and weight gain. Weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue were common side
effects reported in the autism studies. Priapism, hypothermia, sleep apnea syndrome, ileus, urinary retention, diabetes mellitus, and hypoglycemia have been reported in post marketing reports. Very rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with use of the IM
dosage form in patients who have previously tolerated the oral dosage form. In the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment or risk for hypotension, the following adult dosing has been recommended: Start with 0.5 mg PO BID. Increase dose, if needed
and tolerated, in increments no more than 0.5 mg BID. Increases to doses > 1.5 mg BID should occur at intervals of at least 1 wk; slower titration may be required in some patients. Limited studies in pediatric related Tourette’s syndrome, schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior in psychiatric disorders are reported. Autistic disorder safety and efficacy in children <5 yr have not been established. If therapy has been discontinued for a period of time, therapy should be reinitiated with the same initial titration regimen.
Drug is a CYP450 2D6 and 3A4 isoenzyme substrate. Concurrent use of isoenzyme inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and cimetidine) and inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) may increase and decrease the effects of risperidone, respectively. Alcohol, CNS depressants, and St. John’s wort may potentiate the drug’s side effect. Risperidone may enhance the hypotensive effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Oral dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Oral solution can be mixed in water, coffee, orange juice, or low-fat milk but is incompatible with cola or tea.

      Child (3 mo– 14 yr):
           IV: 0.6 mg/kg/dose × 1; if needed, give maintenance doses of 0.075–0.125 mg/kg/dose Q20–30 min PRN when neuromuscular blockade returns to 25% of control. Alternatively, a maintenance continuous IV infusion may be used starting at 7–12 mcg/kg/min (use lower end for children 2–11 yr) when neuromuscular blockade returns to 10% of control.
      Adolescent and adult:
               IV: Start with 0.6–1.2 mg/kg/dose × 1; if needed, maintenance doses at 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/dose Q20–30 min PRN. Alternatively, a maintenance continuous IV infusion may be used starting at 10–12 mcg/kg/min (range: 4–16 mcg/kg/min).

Use with caution in hepatic impairment and history of anaphylaxis with other neuromuscular blocking agents. Hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, wheezing, hiccups, rash, and edema at the injection site may occur.
Myopathy after long term use in an ICU, and QT interval prolongation in pediatric patients receiving general anestetic agents have been reported. Increased neuromuscular blockade may occur with concomitant use of aminoglycosides, clindamycin, tetracycline, magnesium sulfate, quinine, quinidine, succinylcholine, and inhalation anesthetics (for continuous infusion, reduce infusion by 30%–50% at 45–60 min after intubating dose). Caffeine, calcium, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenylephrine, azathioprine, and theophylline may reduce neuromuscular blocking effects Use must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. Peak effects occur in 0.5–1 min for children and in 1–3.7 min for adults. Duration of action: 30–40 min in children and 20–94 min in adults (longer in geriatrics). Recovery time in children 3 mo to 1 yr is similar to adults. To prevent residual paralysis, extubate patient only after the patient has sufficiently recovered from neuromuscular blockade. In obese patients, use actual body weight for dosage calculation."

****************************
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (it is not known if doses lower than the targeted dosages are effective):
      Child 1–< 17 yr (see remarks): Start at 10 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID, then increase dose by ~10 mg/kg/24 hr every other day up to the maximum targeted dose of 45 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID not to exceed 3200 mg/24 hr.
      Child ≥ 17 yr and adult: Start at 400–800 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID, then increase dose by 400–800 mg/24 hr every other day up to the maximum targeted dose of 3200 mg/24 hr ÷ BID.

Contraindicated in Familial Short QT syndrome. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 10 to 15). Use with caution when taking other medications that can shorten the QT interval, performing tasks requiring mental alertness, and in mild/
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 5 to 9), .Common side effects include fatigue, blurred vision, diplopia, ataxia, dizziness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting and shortening of cardiac QT interval. Serious side effects of leukopenia, severe dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome), multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., DRESS), and suicidal ideation have been reported. Rufinamide is a weak inhibitor of CYP 450 2E1 and weak inducer of 3A4. May decrease levels/effects
of nifedipine, nimodipine, piperaquine, calcifediol, clozapine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, triazolam, orlistat, and hormonal contraceptives. May increase the levels/effects of phenytoin and phenobarbital. Primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may decrease the levels/ effects of rufinamide. Whereas, valproic acid may increase the levels/effects of rufinamide. The effectiveness data for 1–4 year old children is based on bridging pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data as their PK and safety data are similar to children \ge 4 yr and adults. Consider dose adjustment for drug loss in patients receiving hemodialysis (rufinamide is dialyzable). Tablets may be crushed and all doses may be administered with or without food"
Salmeterol,"β2-adrenergic agonist (long acting)
*****************************
Persistent asthma (see remarks):
       ≥4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation (50 mcg) Q12 hr

Prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm:
       ≥4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation 30–60 min before exercise. Additional dose should not be used for another 12 hr. Patients who are already using Q12 hr dosing for persistent asthma should not use additional salmeterol doses for this indication and use alternative therapy (e.g., albuterol) prior to exercise.

For long-term asthma control, should be used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. Should not be used to relieve symptoms of acute asthma. It is long acting and has its onset of action in 10–20 min, with a peak effect at 3 hr. May be used QHS (1 inhalation of
the DPI) for nocturnal symptoms. Salmeterol is a chronic medication and is not used in similar fashion to short-acting β-agonists (e.g., albuterol). Patients already receiving salmeterol Q12 hr should not use additional doses for prevention of exercise-induced
bronchospasm; consider alternative therapy. Asthma exacerbations or hospitalizations were reported to be lower when used with an inhaled corticosteroid. WARNING: Long-acting β2-agonists may increase the risk for asthma-related death. A subgroup
analysis suggested higher risk in African-American patients compared with Caucasians. Use salmeterol only as additional therapy for patients not adequately controlled on other asthmacontroller medications (e.g., low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly requires initiation of treatment with two maintenance therapies. Should not be used in conjunction with an inhaled, long-acting β2-agonist and is not a substitute for inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. Use with strong CYP 450 3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, and telithromycin) is not recommended due to risk for cardiovascular adverse events (e.g., QTc prolongation, tachycardia). Salmeterol is a
CYP 450 3A substrate. Proper patient education is essential. Side effects are similar to those of albuterol. Hypertension and arrhythmias have been reported. See Chapter 24 for recommendations for asthma controller therapy"

      Child ≥ 6–12 yr: Start at 25 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 25 mg at 3–4-day intervals or by 50 mg at 7-day intervals up to a max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.
      Child ≥ 13 yr and adult: Start at 50 mg PO once daily. May increase dosage by 50 mg at 1-wk intervals up to max. dose of 200 mg/24 hr.

Drug is contraindicated in combination (or within 14 days of discontinuing use) with an MAO inhibitor (e.g., linezolid or IV methylene blue) or pimozide (increases adverse/toxic effects of pimozide). Use with caution in patients with abnormal bleeding, SIADH, and hepatic or renal impairment. Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, tremor, and increased sweating. Hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus, and platelet dysfunction have been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Use during the late third trimester of pregnancy may increase risk for newborn withdrawal symptoms and persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn. Use with drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, and warfarin) may increase risk for GI bleeds. Use with warfarin may increase PT. Inhibits the CYP450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme. Serotonin syndrome may occur when taken with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g.,
amitriptyline, amphetamines, buspirone, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, and sympathomimetics). Do not abruptly discontinue use; gradually taper dose (4–6 wk has been recommended) to reduce risk for withdrawal symptoms Mix oral concentrate solution with 4 oz. of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice. After mixing, a slight haze may appear; this is normal. This dosage form should be used cautiously in patients with latex allergy because the dropper contains dry natural rubber."

**********************************
Pulmonary hypertension:
     Neonate (limited data from case reports and small clinical trials):
                PO: Several dosages have been reported and have ranged from 0.5–3 mg/kg/dose Q6–12 hr PO.
                    A single ~0.3 mg/kg/dose PO has been used in selected patients to facilitate weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
               IV (case report from four neonates >34-wk gestation and <72-hr old): Start with 0.4 mg/kg/dose IV over 3 hr followed by a continuous infusion of 1.6 mg/kg/24 hr (0.067 mg/kg/hr) for up to 7 days.
    Infant and child (limited data):
              PO: Start at 0.25 mg/kg/dose Q6 hr or 0.5 mg/kg/dose Q8 hr; if needed, titrate dose up to 1–2 mg/kg/dose Q6–8 hr. A single ~0.4 mg/kg/dose PO has been used in selected patients to facilitate weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
   Child 1–17 yr (higher doses and long-term use are associated with increased risk for mortality;see remarks):
            PO:
                ≥8–20 kg: 10 mg TID
                >20–45 kg: 20 mg TID
               >45 kg: 40 mg TID

Pulmonary arterial hypertension:
    Adult:
        PO: 20 mg TID (take at least 4–6 hr apart)
        IV: 10 mg TID

Contraindicated with concurrent use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) and other nitric oxide donors; potentiates hypotensive effects. Use with caution in sepsis (high levels of cGMP may potentiate hypotension), hypotension, and sickle cell anemia (use not established) and with concurrent CYP450 3A4 inhibiting medications (see discussion that follows) and antihypertensive medications. Hepatic insufficiency or severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) significantly reduces sildenafil clearance.
Findings from a dose-ranging study in 1–17-year olds with pulmonary arterial hypertension showed an association of increased mortality risk with long-term use (>2 yr). Headache, pyrexia, URTIs, vomiting, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported side effects in this study. Optimal dosing based on age and body weight still needs to be determined. Hazard ratios for mortality were 3.95 (95% CI: 1.46–10.65) for high versus low doses and 1.92 (95% CI: 0.65–5.65) for medium versus low doses in follow up study for those receiving therapy for ≥3 yr. A subsequent extension open-label study on the same population for an additional 16 weeks reported a greater hazard ratio for mortality with high dose vs. low dose therapy (p = 0.007). In adults, a transient impairment of color discrimination may occur; this effect could increase risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates. Common side effects reported in adults include flushing, rash, diarrhea, indigestion, headache, abnormal vision, and nasal congestion. Hearing
loss has been reported. Sildenafil is substrate for CYP450 3A4 (major) and 2C8/9 (minor). Azole antifungals, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, verapamil, and grapefruit juice may increase the effects/toxicity of sildenafil. Bosentin, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort, and high-fat meals may decrease sildenafil effects."

**********************
Child ≥ 13 yr:
          <40 kg: 3 mg/m2/dose PO × 1 immediately after transplantation, followed by 1 mg/m2/24 hr
            PO ÷ Q12–24 hr on the next day. Adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels.
          ≥40 kg: use adult (low/moderate immunologic risk) ≥40 kg dosage below.

Adult:
     Patients at low/moderate immunologic risk:
         In combination with cyclosporine (adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels):
                <40 kg: 3 mg/m2/dose PO × 1 immediately after transplantation, followed by 1 mg/m2/dose PO  once daily on the next day
                ≥40 kg: 6 mg PO × 1 immediately after transplantation, followed by 2 mg PO once daily on the next day.

Patients at high immunologic risk:
In combination with cyclosporine (withdrawal of cyclosporine is not recommended): 15 mg PO × 1 immediately after transplantation, followed by 5 mg PO once daily on the next day. Adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels.

Increased susceptibility to infection and development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression. Fatal bronchial anastomotic dehiscence has been reported in lung transplantation. Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis have been
reported in liver transplantation when used with tacrolimus. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. Increase risk of BK virus-associated
nephropathies has been reported. Increased mortality in stable liver transplant patients has been reported after conversion from a calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen to sirolimus. Monitor whole blood trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state), especially with pediatric patients, hepatic impairment, concurrent use of CYP450 3A4 and/or P-gp inducers and inhibitors, and/or if cyclosporine dosage is markedly changed or discontinued. Steady state is generally achieved after 5–7 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on specific treatment protocol and assay methodology (HPLC vs. immunoassay vs. LC/MS/MS). Younger children may exhibit faster sirolimus clearance compared with adolescents. Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP450 3A4 and P-gp. Cyclosporine, diltiazem, protease inhibitors, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, and other inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 may increase the toxicity of sirolimus. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John’s wort may decrease the effects of sirolimus. Strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals and clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., rifamycins) are not recommended. Hypertension, peripheral edema, increase serum creatinine, dyspnea, epistaxis, headache, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arthralgia may occur. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diabetes mellitus, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ovarian cysts, and menstrual disorders have been reported. Urinary tract infections have been reported in pediatric renal transplant patients with high immunologic risk. Two mg of the oral solution has been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to 2 mg tablets. However, it is not known whether they are still therapeutically equivalent at higher doses. Reduce maintenance dosage by 1/3 in the presence of hepatic function impairment. Administer doses consistently with or without food. When administered with cyclosporine, give dose 4 hr after cyclosporine. Do not crush or split tablets. Measure the oral liquid dosage form with an amber oral syringe and dilute in a cup with 60 mL of water or orange juice only. Take dose immediately after mixing, add/mix additional 120 mL diluent into the cup, and drink immediately after mixing"

         HCO3− (mEq) = 0.5 × weight (kg) × [24 − serum HCO3− (mEq/L)]

Urinary alkalinization (titrate dose accordingly to urine pH):
        Child: 84–840 mg (1–10 mEq)/kg/24 hr PO ÷ QID
        Adult: 4 g (48 mEq) × 1 followed by 1–2 g (12–24 mEq) PO Q4 hr. Doses up to 16 g (192 mEq)/24 hr have been used.


Contraindicated in respiratory alkalosis, hypochloremia, and inadequate ventilation during cardiac arrest. Use with caution in CHF, renal impairment, cirrhosis, hypocalcemia, hypertension, and concurrent corticosteroids. Maintain high urine output. Monitor acid–base balance and serum electrolytes. May cause hypernatremia (contains sodium), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperreflexia, edema, and tissue necrosis (extravasation). Oral route of administration may cause GI discomfort and gastric rupture from gas production. For direct IV administration (cardiac arrest) in neonates and infants, use the 0.5 mEq/mL (4.2%) concentration or dilute the 1 mEq/mL (8.4%) concentration 1 : 1 with sterile water for injection and infuse at a rate no greater than 10 mEq/min. The 1 mEq/mL (8.4%) concentration may be used in children and adults for direct IV administration. For IV infusions (for all ages), dilute to a max. concentration of 0.5 mEq/mL in dextrose or sterile water for injection and infuse over 2 hr using a max. rate of 1 mEq/kg/hr.

Maintenance for long surgical procedures: 0.04–0.07 mg/kg/dose IV Q5–10 min PRN. Continuous infusion not recommended. Pretreatment with atropine is recommended to reduce incidence of bradycardia. For rapid sequence intubation, see Chapter 1.
Contraindicated after the acute phase of an injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury because severe hyperkalemia and subsequent cardiac arrest may occur. Cardiac arrest has been reported in children and adolescents primarily with skeletal muscle myopathies (e.g., Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy). Identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy prior to use. Predose creatine kinase may be useful for identifying patients at risk.
Monitoring of ECG for peaked T-waves may be useful in detecting early signs of this adverse effect. May cause malignant hyperthermia (use dantrolene to treat), bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia, and hyperkalemia. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported; use caution if previous anaphylactic reaction to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Use with caution in patients with severe burns, paraplegia, or crush injuries and in patients with preexisting hyperkalemia.

Prophylactic therapy: 3 mL/kg/dose intratracheally as soon as possible; up to a total of 3 doses may be given Q12 hr.
Rescue therapy (treatment; see remarks): 3 mL/kg/dose intratracheally immediately after the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). May repeat dose as needed Q12 hr to max. of 3 doses total.

Method of administration for previously listed therapies (see remarks): Suction infant prior to administration. 

Manufacturer recommends administration through a side-port adapter into the endotracheal tube with two attendants (one to instill drug and another to monitor and position patient). 
Each dose is divided into two 1.5-mL/kg aliquots; administer 1.5 mL/kg in each of the two different positions (infant positioned to the right or left-side dependent). 
Drug is administered while ventilation is continued over 20–30 breaths for each aliquot, with small bursts timed only during the inspiratory cycles. 

A pause followed by evaluation of respiratory status and repositioning should separate the two aliquots. 
The drug has also been administered by dividing dose into four equal aliquots and administered with repositioning in the prone, supine, right, and left lateral positions.
Common adverse effects include cyanosis, airway obstruction, bradycardia, reflux of surfactant into the ET tube, requirement for manual ventilation, and reintubation. 
Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose such that oxygen therapy and ventilator pressure are adjusted as necessary.
All doses administered intratracheally via a 5 french feeding catheter. If suspension settles during storage, gently swirl the contents—do not shake. Drug is stored in the refrigerator, protected from light, and does not need to be warmed before administration. Unopened vials that have been warmed to room temperature (once only) may be refrigerated within 24 hours and stored for future use. For rescue therapy, repeat doses may be administered as early as 6 hr after the previous dose for a total of up to 4 doses if the infant is still intubated and requires at least 30% inspired oxygen to maintain a PaO2 ≥ 80 torr"

Rescue therapy (treatment): 2.5 mL/kg/dose × 1 intratracheally, immediately following the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). May administer 1.25 mL/kg/dose Q12 hr × 2 doses as needed up to a max. total dose of 5 mL/kg.

Method of administration (see remarks): Suction infant prior to administration. Each dose is divided into two aliquots, with each aliquot administered into one of the two main bronchi by positioningthe infant with either the right or left side dependent. After the first aliquot is administered, remove the catheter from the ET tube and manually ventilate the infant with 100% oxygen at a rate of 40–60 breaths/min for 1 min. When the infant is stable, reposition the infant and administer the second dose with the same procedures. Then remove the catheter without flushing. Currently FDA approved for the treatment (rescue therapy) of RDS. Transient episodes of bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, reflux of surfactant into the ET tube, and airway obstruction have occurred during dose administration. Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose, and adjust oxygen therapy and ventilator pressure as necessary. Pulmonary hemorrhage has been reported. All doses administered intratracheally via a 5 french feeding catheter. Suction infant prior to administration and 1 hr after surfactant instillation (unless signs of significant airway obstruction). Drug is stored in the refrigerator and protected from light. Each vial of drug should be slowly warmed to room temperature and gently turned upside down for uniform suspension (do not shake) before administration.

Tacrolimus,"Immunosuppressant
*****************
SYSTEMIC USE:
   Child:
      Liver transplantation without preexisting renal or hepatic dysfunction (initial doses;titrate to therapeutic levels):
           IV: 0.03–0.05 mg/kg/24 hr by continuous infusion
          PO: 0.15–0.2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr
 Adult (initial doses; titrate to therapeutic levels):
        IV: 0.01–0.05 mg/kg/24 hr by continuous infusion
       PO: 0.075–0.2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr

Liver transplantation: 0.1–0.15 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr
Kidney transplantation: 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr
Cardiac transplantation: 0.075 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q12 hr

TOPICAL USE:
Atopic dermatitis (continue treatment for 1 wk after clearing of signs and symptoms; see remarks):
       Child ≥ 2–15 yr old: Apply a thin layer of the 0.03% ointment to the affected skin areas BID and rub in gently and completely.
       Adolescent ≥ 16 yr and adult: Apply a thin layer of the 0.03% or 0.1% ointment to the affected skin areas BID and rub in gently and completely.

Avoid use in patients with prolonged cardiac QT intervals. IV dosage form contraindicated in patients allergic to polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil (cremophor). Experience in pediatric kidney transplantation is limited. Pediatric patients may require higher mg/kg doses than adults. For BMT use (beginning 1 day before BMT), dose and therapeutic levels similar to those in liver transplantation have been used. Major adverse events include tremor, headache, insomnia, diarrhea, constipation, hypertension, nausea, and renal dysfunction. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, confusion, depression, infections, lymphoma, liver enzyme elevation, and coagulation disorders may also occur. GI perforation, agranulocytosis, and hemolytic anemia have been reported.
Tacrolimus is a substrate of the CYP450 3A4 drug metabolizing enzyme. Calcium channel blockers, imidazole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clotrimazole, and posaconazole), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin), cisapride, cimetidine, cyclosporine, danazol, herbal products containing schisandra sphenanthera extracts, methylprednisolone, and grapefruit juice can increase tacrolimus serum levels. In contrast, carbamazepine, caspofungin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, and sirolimus may decrease levels. Use with sirolimus may increase risk for hepatic artery thrombosis. Use with other CYP450 3A inhibitors and substrates has the potential to prolong the cardiac QT interval. Reduce dose in renal or hepatic insufficiency Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after 2–5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay methodology (whole-blood ELISA vs. MEIA vs. HPLC). Whole-blood trough concentrations of 5–20 ng/ mL have been recommended in liver transplantation at 1–12 mo. Trough levels of 7–20 ng/mL (whole blood) for the first 3 mo and 5–15 ng/mL after 3 mo have been recommended in renaltransplantation.
Tacrolimus therapy generally should be initiated 6 hr or more after transplantation. PO is the preferred route of administration, and administration should be done on an empty stomach. Safety and efficacy of the extended-release capsules (Astragraf XL) have not been established for kidney transplant patients < 16 yr old. Extended-release tablets (Envarsus XR) are currently labelled for use in adult kidney transplant patients being converted from an immediate-release tacrolimus formulation. An 80% conversion factor has been recommended for African-Americans converted from immediate-release dosage form to Envarsus XR. All extended-release formulations are NOT interchangeable. IV infusions should be administered at concentrations between 0.004 and
0.02 mg/mL diluted with NS or D5W. 

TOPICAL USE: Not recommended for use in patients with skin conditions with a skin barrier defect with the potential for systemic absorption. Do not use in children < 2 yr, immunocompromised patients, or patients with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Approved as a second-line therapy for short-term and intermittent treatment of atopic dermatitis for patients who fail to respond or do not tolerate other approved therapies. Long-term safety is unknown. Skin burn
sensation, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reaction, skin erythema, headache, and skin infection are the most common side effects. Application site edema has been reported. Although the risk is uncertain, the FDA has issued an alert about the potential cancer risk with the use of this product. See www.fda.gov/medwatch for the latest information"

             ≥45 kg: Begin therapy with 300 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6–8 hr. If needed based on serum levels, gradually increase to 400–600 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6–8 hr.

Drug metabolism varies widely with age, drug formulation, and route of administration. Most common side effects and toxicities are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux, nervousness, tachycardia, seizures, and arrhythmias.
Serum levels should be monitored. Therapeutic levels: bronchospasm: 10–20 mg/L; apnea: 7–13 mg/L.Half-life is age dependent: 30 hr (newborns); 6.9 hr (infants); 3.4 hr (children); 8.1 hr (adults). See Aminophylline for guidelines for serum level determinations. Liver impairment, cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. Theophylline is a substrate for CYP450 1A2. Levels are increased with allopurinol, alcohol, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, clarithromycin, disulfiram,
erythromycin, estrogen, isoniazid, propranolol, thiabendazole, and verapamil. Levels are decreased with carbamazepine, isoproterenol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin. May cause increased skeletal muscle activity, agitation, and hyperactivity when used with doxapram and increases quinine levels/toxicity. Use ideal body weight in obese patients when calculating dosage because of poor distribution into body fat. Risk factors for increased clearance include: smoking, cystic fibrosis, hyperthyroidism, and
high-protein diet. Factors for decreased clearance include CHF, correction of hyperthyroidism, fever, viral illness, sepsis, and high carbohydrate diet. Suggested dosage intervals for sustained-released products (see following table):

>12 yr and adult: Start with 75–300 mg/24 hr PO ÷ TID. Then gradually increase PRN to max. dose 800 mg/24 hr ÷ BID–QID.


Indicated for schizophrenia unresponsive to standard therapy. Contraindicated in severe CNS depression, brain damage, narrow-angle glaucoma, blood dyscrasias, and severe liver or cardiovascular disease. DO NOT co-administer with drugs that may inhibit the CYP450 2D6 isoenzymes (e.g., SSRIs such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine; and β-blockers such as propranolol and pindolol); drugs that may widen the QTc interval (e.g., disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine); and in patients with known reduced activity of CYP450 2D6. May cause drowsiness, extrapyramidal reactions, autonomic symptoms, ECG changes (QTc prolongation in a dose-dependent manner), arrhythmias, paradoxical reactions, and endocrine disturbances. Long-term use may cause tardive dyskinesia. Pigmentary retinopathy may occur with higher doses; a periodic eye exam is recommended. More autonomic symptoms and less extrapyramidal effects than chlorpromazine. Concurrent use with epinephrine can cause
hypotension. Increased cardiac arrhythmias may occur with tricyclic antidepressants. In an overdose situation, monitor ECG and avoid drugs that can widen QTc interval"

Adjunctive therapy for refractory seizures (see remarks):
    Child ≥ 2 yr (limited data from a safety and tolerability study in 52 children 2–17 yr, mean 9.3 ± 4.1): 
                Initial dose of 0.25 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ TID × 4 wk. Dosage was increasedat 4-wk intervals to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg/24 hr until an effective and well-tolerated dose was established. 
                Criteria for dose increase required tolerance of the current dosage level and <50% reduction in seizures. 
                 Patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepiletic drugs (AEDs) received a max. daily dose of 0.73 ± 0.44 mg/kg/24 hr and patients receiving non–enzyme-inducing AEDs received a max. of 0.61 ± 0.32 mg/kg/24 hr

Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures (dosage based on use with enzyme-inducing AEDs; see remarks). 
NOTE: patients receiving non–enzyme-inducing AEDs results in tiagabine blood levels about two times higher than patients receiving enzyme-inducing AEDs.
≥12 yr and adult: Start at 4 mg PO once daily × 7 days. If needed, increase dose to 8 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Dosage may be increased further by 4–8 mg/24 hr at weekly intervals (daily doses may be divided BID–QID) until a clinical response is achieved or up to specified max. dose.

Max. dose:
   12–18 yr: 32 mg/24 hr

Adult: 56 mg/24 hr

Use with caution in hepatic insufficiency (may need to reduce dose and/or increase dosing interval). Most common side effects include dizziness, somnolence, depression, confusion, and asthenia. Nervousness, tremor, nausea, abdominal pain, confusion, and difficulty in concentrating may also occur. Cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting in nonconvulsive status epilepticus requiring subsequent dose reduction or drug discontinuation have been reported. Suicidal behavior or ideation, bullous dermatitis, and
blurred vision have been reported. Off-label use in patients WITHOUT epilepsy is discouraged due to reports of seizures in these patients. Tiagabine’s clearance is increased by concurrent hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g.,
phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates). Lower doses or a slower titration for clinical response may be necessary for patients receiving non–enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine). Avoid abrupt discontinuation of drug.
TID dosing schedule may be preferred since BID schedule may not be well tolerated. Doses should be administered with food "

Use with caution in combination with neurotoxic, ototoxic, or nephrotoxic drugs; anesthetics or neuromuscular blocking agents; preexisting renal, vestibular or auditory impairment; and in patients with neuromuscular disorders. May cause ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neuromuscular blockade. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome have been reported rarely. Ototoxic effects synergistic with furosemide. Higher doses are recommended in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or burns. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 30). Monitor peak and trough levels. Therapeutic peak levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing:
6–10 mg/L in general
8–10 mg/L in pulmonary infections, neutropenia, osteomyelitis, and severe sepsis 

Therapeutic trough levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing: <2 mg/L. 
Recommended serum sampling time at steady-state; trough within 30 min prior to the third consecutive dose and peak 30–60 min after the administration of the third consecutive dose.
Therapeutic peak and trough goals for high-dose extended-interval dosing for cystic fibrosis:
Peak: 20–40 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time at 30–60 min after the administration of the first dose.
Trough: <1 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time within 30 min before the second dose.

Serum levels should be rechecked with changing renal function, poor clinical response, and at a minimum of once weekly for prolonged therapies.
To maximize bactericidal effects, an individualized peak concentration to target a peak/MIC ratio of 8–10 : 1 may be applied.
For initial dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 (Total Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight).

Week 4 and beyond             50 mg                                       50 mg

Use clinical outcome to guide dose and titration. Longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used. Use with caution in renal and hepatic dysfunction (decreased clearance) and sulfa hypersensitivity. Reduce dose by 50% when creatinine clearance is < 70 mL/min. Common side effects (incidence lower in children) include ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, dizziness, nystagmus, paresthesia, sedation, visual disturbances, nausea, dyspepsia, and kidney stones (incidence higher in children). Secondary angle closure glaucoma characterized by ocular pain, acute myopia, and increased intraocular pressure has been reported and may lead to blindness if left untreated. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if
they experience blurred vision or periorbital pain. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia have been reported primarily in children and should be monitored especially during hot weather and with use of drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders (e.g., carbonic anyhdrase inhibitors and anticholinergics). Low serum bicarbonate levels have been reported in pediatric clinical trials. Hyperchloremic, non–anion gap metabolic acidosis has also been reported. Suicidal behavior or
ideation has been reported. Drug is metabolized by and inhibits the CYP450 2C19 isoenzyme. Phenytoin, valproic acid, and carbamazepine may decrease topiramate levels. Topiramate may decrease valproic acid, digoxin, and ethinyl estradiol (to decrease oral contraceptive efficacy), but may increase phenytoin levels. Alcohol and CNS depressants may increase CNS side effects. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) may increase risk of metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, or paresthesia. Use with
valproic acid may result in the development of hyperammonemia. Safety and efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in pediatrics have not been established; an increase in serum creatinine has been reported in a clinical trial.
Qudexy XR and Trokendi XR are not bioequivalent and should not be interchanged. Doses may be administered with or without food. Capsule may be opened and sprinkled on small amount of food (e.g., 1 teaspoonful of applesauce) and swallowed whole (do not chew). Maintain adequate hydration to prevent kidney stone formation"

Use with caution in preexisting cardiac disease, initial recovery phase of MI, in patients receiving antihypertensive medications, renal and hepatic impairment (has not been evaluated), and electroconvulsive therapy. Common side effects include dizziness,
drowsiness, dry mouth, and diarrhea. May cause angle-closure glaucoma in patients with anatomically narrow angles who do not have an iridectomy. Seizures, tardive dyskinesia, EPS, arrhythmias, priapism, blurred vision, neuromuscular weakness, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and rash have been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Trazodone is a CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme substrate (may interact with inhibitors and inducers) and may increase digoxin levels and increase CNS effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. Max. antidepressant effect is seen at 2–6 wk"

                 20–31 kg: 500 mg PO TID
                 ≥32 kg: 750 mg PO TID

Chickenpox (immunocompetent patient; initiate therapy at earliest signs or symptoms, within 24 hr of rash onset):
          2–<18 yr: 20 mg/kg/dose PO TID × 5 days; max. dose: 1 g/dose TID.

HSV treatment (immunocompetent):
          3 mo–11 yr: 20 mg/kg/dose PO BID; max. dose: 1000 mg/dose

Herpes zoster (see remarks):
           Adult (immunocompetent): 1 g/dose PO TID × 7 days within 48–72 hr of onset of rash.

Genital herpes:
         Adolescent and adult:
                Initial episodes: 1 g/dose PO BID × 10 days.
                Recurrent episodes: 500 mg/dose PO BID × 3 days.

Suppressive therapy:
        Immunocompetent patient: 500–1000 mg/dose PO once daily × 1 year, then reassess for recurrences. Patients with <9 recurrences per yr may be dosed at 500 mg/dose PO once daily × 1 yr.
Herpes labialis (cold sores; initiated at earliest symptoms):
≥12 yr and adult: 2 g/dose PO Q12 hr × 1 day.

This prodrug is metabolized to acyclovir and L-valine with better oral absorption than acyclovir. Use with caution in hepatic or renal insufficiency. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) has been reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and in bone marrow and renal transplant recipients. Probenecid or cimetidine can reduce the rate of conversion to acyclovir. Headache, nausea, and abdominal pain are common adverse events in adults. Headache is
common in children. See Acyclovir for additional drug interactions and adverse effects. For initial episodes of genital herpes, therapy is most effective when initiated within 48 hr of symptom onset. Therapy should be initiated immediately after the onset of symptoms in recurrent episodes (no efficacy data when initiating therapy > 24 hr after onset of symptoms). Data are not available for use as suppressive therapy for periods > 1 yr. Valacyclovir CANNOT be substituted for acyclovir on a one-to-one basis. Doses may be administered with or without food"

Neonate and infant:
               Symptomatic congenital CMV [from pharmacokinetic (PK) data in 8 infants 4–90 days old (mean: 20 days) and 24 neonates 8–34 days old]:
                      15–16 mg/kg/dose PO BID produced similar levels to IV ganciclovir 6 mg/kg/dose BID. 
                 A comparison of 6 weeks vs. 6 months of therapy in 96 neonates (>32-wk gestation and ≥1.8 kg) showed modest improvement in long-term hearing and developmental outcomes at 1–2 yr of age with the longer duration of therapy of 6 months.

Child (1 mo–16 yr):
       CMV prophylaxis in kidney (4 mo–16 yr), heart (1 mo–16 yr), or liver (4 mo–16 yr) transplantation (see remarks): 
       Once daily PO dosage is calculated with the following equation.
              Daily mg dose (max. dose: 900 mg) = 7 × BSA × CrCl. BSA is determined by the Mosteller equation and CrCl is determined by a modified Schwartz equation (max. value: 150 mL/ min/1.73 m2).

Mosteller BSA (m2) equation: square root of [(height (cm) × weight (kg)) ÷ 3600]
Modified Schwartz (mL/min/1.73 m2) equation (max. value: 150 mL/min/1.73 m2): k × height (cm) ÷ serum creatinine (mg/dL); where k = 0.33 if patient is < 1 yr old with low birth weight for gestational age; k = 0.45 if patient is < 1 yr old with birth weight appropriate for gestational age or if patient is 1–<2 yr old; k = 0.55 for boys 2–<13 yr old and girls 2–<16 yr old; or k = 0.7 for boys 13–16 yr old.

Duration of therapy:
       Kidney transplantation (≥4 mo–16 yr): 200 days
       Heart transplantation (≥1 mo–16 yr): 100 days
       Liver transplantation: see remarks.

Adolescent (>16 yr) and adult:
   CMV retinitis:
            Induction therapy: 900 mg PO BID × 21 days with food
            Maintenance therapy: 900 mg PO once daily with food

CMV prophylaxis in heart, kidney, and kidney-pancreas transplantation: 900 mg PO once daily starting within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post heart or kidney–pancreas transplantation, or until 200 days post kidney transplantation.

This prodrug is metabolized to ganciclovir, with better oral absorption than ganciclovir. Contraindicated with hypersensitivity to valganciclovir/ganciclovir; ANC < 500 mm3; platelets < 25,000 mm3; hemoglobin < 8 g/dL; and patients on hemodialysis. Use with
caution in renal insufficiency (adjust dose; see Chapter 30), preexisting bone marrow suppression, or in those receiving myelosupressive drugs or irradiation. Has not been evaluated in hepatic impairment. May cause headache, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy,
diarrhea, vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia incidence is greater at day 200 vs day 100 in pediatric kidney transplant patients. Use effective contraception during and for at least 90 days after therapy; may impair fertility in men
and women. See Ganciclovir for drug interactions and additional adverse effects. CMV prophylaxis data in liver transplantation is limited. A retrospective review in 10 pediatric patients, mean age 4.9 ± 5.6 yr, showed that 15–18 mg/kg/dose PO once daily × 100 days
following liver transplantation resulted in 1 case of asymptomatic CMV infection detected by CMV antigenemia at day 7 of therapy. This patient then received a higher dose of 15 mg/kg/dose BID until three consecutive negative CMV antigenemia were achieved. The dose was switched back to a prophylactic regimen at day 46 posttransplant. Monitor serum creatinine levels regularly and consider body changes to height and body weight for prophylaxis dosing. Valganciclovir CANNOT be substituted for ganciclovir on a one-to-one basis. All doses are administered with food. Avoid direct skin or mucous membrane contact with broken or crushed tablets"

    Load: 20 mg/kg/dose
    Maintenance: 10–15 mg/kg/dose Q8 hr

Migraine prophylaxis:
    Child (limited data): 15–30 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID; alternative dosing for children ≥ 12 yr is 250 mg PO BID (max. dose: 1000 mg/24 hr).
    Adult: Start with 500 mg/24 hr ÷ PO BID. Dose may be increased to a max. of 1000 mg/24 hr ÷ PO BID. If using divalproex sodium extended-release tablets, administer daily dose once daily.

Contraindicated in hepatic disease, pregnancy (for migraine indication), mitochondrial disorders with mutations in DNA polymerase gamma (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome), and children < 2 yr suspected of the aforementioned mitochondrial disorder. May cause GI, liver, blood, and CNS toxicity; weight gain; transient alopecia; pancreatitis (potentially life-threatening); nausea; sedation; vomiting; headache; thrombocytopenia (dose-related); platelet dysfunction; rash (especially with lamotrigine); and hyperammonemia. Hepatic failure has occurred especially in children < 2 yr (especially those receiving multiple anticonvulsants, with congenital metabolic disorders, with severe seizure disorders with mental retardation, and with organic brain disease). Idiosyncratic life-threatening pancreatitis has been reported in children and adults. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has been reported in patients with urea cycle disorders. Suicidal behavior or ideation, male infertility, elevated testosterone, decreased bone mineral density, DRESS, hair texture/color changes, and nail/nail bed disorders have been reported. Valproic acid is a substrate for CYP450 2C19 isoenzyme and an inhibitor of CYP450 2C9, 2D6, and 3A3/4 (weak). It increases amitriptyline/nortriptyline, rufinamide, phenytoin, diazepam, and phenobarbital levels. Concomitant phenytoin, phenobarbital, topiramate, meropenem, cholestyramine, and carbamazepine may decrease valproic acid levels. Amitriptyline or nortriptyline may increase valproic acid levels. May interfere with urine ketone and thyroid tests. Do not give syrup with carbonated beverages. Use of IV route has not been evaluated for >14 days of continuous use. Infuse IV over 1 hr up to a max. rate of 20 mg/min. Depakote and Depakote ER are NOT bioequivalent; see package insert for dose conversion. Therapeutic levels: 50–100 mg/L. Recommendations for serum sampling at steady-state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 2–3 days of continuous dosing. Levels of 50–60 mg/L and as high as 85 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders. Monitor CBC and LFTs prior to and during therapy. Valprioc acid and divalproex should not be used in pregnant women. Increased risk of neural tube defects, decreased child IQ scores, craniofacial defects, and cardiovascular malformations have been reported in babies exposed to valproic acid and divalproex sodium. Pregnancy category is “X” when used for migraine prophylaxis and is a “D” for all other indications"

Clostridium difficile colitis (PR route of administration may be preferable for complete ileus):
       Child: 40–50 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ Q6 hr PO × 7–10 days. Max. dose: 500 mg/24 hr; higher maximum of 2 g/24 hr have also been used.
       Adult: 125 mg/dose PO Q6 hr × 7–10 days; dosages as high as 2 g/24 hr ÷ Q6–8 hr have also been used.

Endocarditis prophylaxis for GU or GI (excluding esophageal) procedures (complete all antibiotic dose infusion(s) within 30 min of starting procedure):
Moderate-risk patients allergic to ampicillin or amoxicillin:
       Child: 20 mg/kg/dose IV over 1–2 hr × 1
       Adult: 1 g/dose IV over 1–2 hr × 1

High-risk patients allergic to ampicillin or amoxicillin:
    Child and adult: Same dose as moderate-risk patients plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg/dose (max.dose: 120 mg/dose) IV/IM ×1

Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur and may be exacerbated with concurrent aminoglycoside use. Greater nephrotoxicity risk has been associated with higher therapeutic serum trough concentrations (≥15 mg/mL), concurrent piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, and receiving furosemide in the intensive care unit. Adjust dose in renal failure. Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Low concentrations of the drug may appear in CSF with inflamed meninges. Nausea, vomiting, and drug-induced erythroderma are common with IV use. “Red man syndrome” associated with rapid IV infusion may occur. Infuse over 60 min (may infuse over 120 min if 60 min infusion is not tolerated). NOTE: Diphenhydramine is used to reverse red man syndrome.
Allergic reactions [including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)], neutropenia, and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia have been reported. Although current extrapolated adult guidelines suggest measuring only trough levels, an additional postdistributional level may be useful in characterizing enhanced/altered drug clearance for quicker dosage modification to attain target levels; this may be useful for infants with known faster clearance and patients in renal compromise. Consult a pharmacist The following therapeutic trough level recommendations are based on the assumption that the pathogen’s Vancomycin MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L. Indication Goal Trough Level Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection, non-MRSA bacteremia,
febrile neutropenia 10–15 mg/L CNS infections, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, MRSA bacteremia 15–20 mg/L Peak level measurement (20–50 mg/L) has also been recommended for patients with burns, clinically nonresponsive in 72 hr of therapy, with persistent positive cultures, and with CNS infections (≥30 mg/L). Recommended serum sampling time at steady-state: Trough within 30 min prior to the fourth consecutive dose and peak 60 min after the administration of the fourth consecutive dose. Infants
with faster elimination (shorter T1/2) may be sampled around the third consecutive dose. ORAL USE: Metronidazole (PO) is the drug of choice for C. difficile colitis; vancomycin should be avoided due to the emergence of vancomycin resistant enterococcus. Common adverse effects with oral vancomycin capsules in adults include nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia. Pregnancy category “C” for the intravenous route and “B” for the oral route of administration"
Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (Human),"Hyperimmune globulin, varicella-zoster

Infantile spams (1 mo–2 yr; see remarks for discontinuation of therapy): Start at 50 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO; if needed and tolerated, may titrate dosage upwards by 25–50-mg/kg/24 hr increments Q3 days up to a maximum of 150 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID. Withdrawal therapy if no clinical benefit is seen in 2–4 weeks.

Adjunctive therapy for refractory complex partial seizures (withdraw therapy if no clinical benefit is seen in 3 months; see remarks for discontinuation of therapy):
       Child (≥10 kg): Start at 40 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO, if needed and tolerated, adjust dose to the following maintenance dose:
               10–15 kg: 500–1000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
               16–30 kg: 1000–1500 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
               31–50 kg: 1500–3000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID
               >50 kg: 2000–3000 mg/24 hr ÷ BID

Adolescent (≥16 yr) and adult (see remarks for discontinuation of therapy): Start at 500 mg BID PO, if needed and tolerated, increase daily dose by 500 mg increments at 7 day intervals. 
      Usual dose: 1500 mg BID; max. dose: 6000 mg/24 hr. Doses > 3 g/24 hr have not been shown to provide additional benefit and are associated with more side effects.

Use with caution in renal impairment and other CNS depressants (enhanced effects). Can cause progressive and permanent vision loss (risk increases with dose and duration); periodic vision testing is required. Common side effects in children and adults include rash, weight gain, GI disturbances, arthralgia, visual disturbances, vertigo, sedation, headache, confusion, and URIs. Liver failure, anemia,psychotic disorder, angioedema, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, TEN, and suicidal ideation have been reported. Dose-dependent abnormal MRIs have been reported in infants treated for infantile spasms. Ketorolac, naproxen, and mefloquine may decrease the effect of vigabitrin. Vigabitrin may decrease the effects/levels of phenytoin but increase the levels/toxicity of carbamazepine. Use in adjunctive therapy for refractory complex partial seizure has labeled indication for ≥10-yr-old  patients when potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss. 

DO NOT rapidly withdraw therapy. Dosage needs to be tapered when discontinuing therapy to minimize increased seizure frequency. The following tapering guidelines have been recommended:
        Infant: decrease by 25–50 mg/kg every 3–4 days
       Child: decrease dose by 1/3 every 7 days for 3 weeks
       Adult: decrease by 1 g/24 hr every 7 days 
Doses may be administered with or without food."

Contraindicated with concomitant administration with rifampin, carbamazepine, long acting  barbiturates, ritonavir, efavirenz, rifabutin, ergot alkaloids, or St. John’s Wort (decreases voriconazole levels); and with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, or sirolimus (voriconazole increases levels of these drugs to increase side effects). Use with caution in proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., congenital/acquired QTc prolongation, cardiomyopathy, and sinus bradycardia), severe hepatic disease, galactose intolerance, and concurrent use with CYP450 3A4 substrates that can lead to prolonged QTc interval (e.g., cisapride, pimozide, and quinidine). Drug is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP450 2C9, 2C19 (major substrate), and 3A4 isoenzymes. Currently approved for use in invasive aspergillosis, candidal esophagitis, and Fusarium and
Scedosporium apiospermum infections. Common side effects include GI disturbances, fever, headache, hepatic abnormalities, photosensitivity (avoid direct sunlight and use protective measures), rash (6%), and visual disturbances (30%). Serious but rare side effects include anaphylaxis, liver or renal failure, and Stevens–Johnsons syndrome. Pancreatitis has been reported in children. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin levels weekly for the first month of therapy followed by reduced frequency has been recommended. Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels before and during voriconzole therapy. Adjust dose in hepatic impairment by decreasing only the maintenance dose by 50% for patients with a Child-Pugh Class A or B. Do not use IV dosage form for patients with GFR <50 mL/min because of accumulation of the cyclodextrin excipient; switch to oral therapy if possible. Patients receiving concurrent phenytoin should increase their voriconazole maintenance doses (IV: 5 mg/kg/dose Q 12 hr; PO: double the usual dose). See www.clinicaltrials.gov for updated Pediatrics clinical trial information. Interoccasion  pharmacokinetic variability is high, thus requiring serum level monitoring. Therapeutic levels: trough:
1–5.5 mg/L. Levels <1 mg/L have resulted in treatment failures and levels >5.5 mg/L have resulted in neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain trough within 30 min prior to a dose. Steady state is typically achieved after 5–7 days of initiating therapy. Administer IV over 1–2 hr with a max. rate of 3 mg/kg/hr at a concentration ≤ 5 mg/mL. Administer oral doses 1 hr before and after meals"

           Liver dysfunction, baseline INR > 1.3, cardiopulmonary bypass within previous 10 days, NPO status/poor nutrition, receiving broad spectrum antibiotics, receiving medications that significantly inhibit CYP450 2C9, or slow metabolizers of warfarin (see remarks): 0.05–0.1 mg/ kg/dose PO; max. dose: 5 mg/dose

Immediate post-operative period after a Fontan procedure: 0.05 mg/kg/dose PO; max. dose:
2.5 mg/dose

(missing table)

Usual maintenance dose: ~0.1 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily; range: 0.05–0.34 mg/kg/24 hr. See remarks.
       Adult (see remarks): 5–10 mg PO once daily × 2–5 days. Adjust dose to achieve the desired INR or PT. Maintenance dose range: 2–10 mg/24 hr PO once daily.


Contraindicated in severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled bleeding, GI ulcers, and malignant hypertension. Acts on vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X.
Side effects include fever, skin lesions, skin necrosis (especially in protein C deficiency), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and hemoptysis. Warfarin is a substrate for CYP450 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, and 3A3/4. Chloramphenicol, chloral hydrate, cimetidine, delavirdine, fluconazole, fluoxetine, metronidazole, indomethacin, large doses of vitamins A or E, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, omeprazole, oxandrolone, quinidine, salicylates, SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), sulfonamides, and zafirlukast may increase warfarin’s effect. Ascorbic acid, barbiturates, carbamazepine, cholestyramine, dicloxacillin, griseofulvin, oral contraceptives, rifampin, spironolactone, sucralfate, and vitamin K (including foods with high content) may decrease warfarin’s effect. Younger children generally require higher doses to achieve desired effect. A cohort study of 319 children found that infants < 1 yr required an average daily dose of 0.33 mg/kg and teenagers 11–18 yr required 0.09 mg/kg to maintain a target INR of 2–3. Children receiving Fontan cardiac surgery may require smaller doses than children with either congenital heart disease (without Fontan) or no congenital heart disease. [See Chest. 2004;126:645–687S and Blood. 1999;94(9):3007–3014 for additional information.]
Lower initial doses should be considered for patients with pharmacogenetic variations in CYP2C9 (e.g., *2 and *3 alleles) and VKORC1 (e.g., 1639G>A allele) enzymes, elderly and/or debilitated patients, and patients with a potential to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to warfarin. The international normalized ratio (INR) is the recommended test to monitor warfarin anticoagulant effect. It takes 5–7 days for an INR to reach steady state on a consistent dosing schedule. The particular INR desired is based upon the indication and has been extrapolated from adults. An INR of 2–3 has been recommended for prophylaxis and treatment of DVT, pulmonary emboli, and bioprosthetic heart valves. An INR of 2.5–3.5 has been recommended for mechanical prosthetic heart valves and the prevention of recurrent systemic emboli. If PT is monitored, it should be 1.5–2 times the control. Patients at high risk for bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring. Onset of action occurs within 36–72 hr and peak effects occur within 5–7 days. IV dosing is equivalent to PO doses and is used in situations where oral dosing is not possible. The antidote is vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. Pregnancy category is “D” for women with mechanical heart valves and “X” for all others indications"

Use with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Dosage reduction is recommended in severe renal impairment and may be necessary in hepatic dysfunction. Drug penetrates well into the CNS. Most common side effects include anemia,
granulocytopenia, nausea, and headache (dosage reduction, erythropoietin, filgrastim/GCSF, or discontinuance may be required depending on event). Seizures, confusion, rash, myositis, myopathy (use > 1 yr), hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Macrocytosis is noted after 4 wk of therapy and can be used as an indicator of compliance Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases have been reported. Neutropenia and severe anemia has been reported in advanced HIV disease. Do not use in combination with stavudine because of poor antiretroviral effect. Effects of interacting drugs include increased toxicity (acyclovir and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); increased hematological toxicity (ganciclovir, interferon-α, and marrow suppressive drugs); and granulocytopenia (drugs which affect glucuronidation). Methadone, atovaquone, cimetidine, valproic acid, probenecid, and fluconazole may increase levels of zidovudine. Whereas, rifampin, rifabutin,
and clarithromycin may decrease levels. Do not administer IM. IV form is incompatible with blood product infusions and should be infused over 1 hr (intermittent IV dosing). Despite manufacturer recommendations of administering oral
doses 30 min prior to or 1 hr after meals, doses may be administered with food"
"Zinc Salts, Systemic","Trace mineral
***********
Zinc deficiency (see remarks):
               Infant and child: 0.5–1 mg elemental Zn/kg/24 hr PO ÷ once daily–TID
               Adult: 25–50 mg elemental Zn/dose (100–220 mg Zn sulfate/dose) PO TID
Wilson’s disease:
              Child (≥10 yr): 75 mg/24 hr elemental Zn PO ÷ TID; if needed, may increase to 150 mg/24 hr elemental Zn PO ÷ TID


Nausea, vomiting, GI disturbances, leukopenia, and diaphoresis may occur. Gastric ulcers, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur at high doses. Patients with excessive losses (burns) or impaired absorption require higher doses. Therapeutic levels: 70–130 mcg/dL.
Parenteral products may contain aluminum; use with caution in renal impairment. May decrease the absorption of penicillamine, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin). Drugs that increase gastric pH (e.g., H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) can reduce the absorption of zinc. Excessive zinc administration can cause copper deficiency. Approximately 20%–30% of oral dose is absorbed. Oral doses may be administered with food if GI upset occurs. Pregnancy category is “A” for zinc acetate and “C” for all other salt forms"

Treatment of acute migraines with or without aura:
       Oral (Safety of an average of >3 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established;see remarks):
    Adult:
       PO tabs: Start with 1.25–2.5 mg PO × 1. If needed in 2 hr, a second dose may be administered.
           Dose may be increased to a maximum single dose of 5 mg if needed. Max. daily dose: 10 mg/24 hr.
     ODT tabs: Use the same dosage recommendation for PO tabs but with a 2.5 mg initial dose.
     Nasal (safety of an average of >4 headaches in a 30 day period has not been established; see remarks):
         ≥12 yr and adult: Start with 2.5 mg inhaled into a single nostril × 1. If needed in 2 hr, a second dose may be administered. Dose may be increased to a maximum single dose of 5 mg if needed.
         Max. daily dose: 10 mg/24 hr.

Patients receiving concurrent cimetidine: Limit maximum doses to 2.5 mg as the max. single dose and do not exceed 5 mg in any 24 hr period.

Contraindicated in ischemic bowel disease; ischemic coronary artery disease; uncontrolled hypertension; peripheral vascular disease; history of stroke or TIA, arrhythmias, and hemiplegic or basilar migraine; significant cardiovascular disease; and coronary artery
vasospasm. Do not administer with any ergotamine-containing medication ergot-type medication, any other 5-HT1 agonist (e.g., triptans), methylene blue, or with/within 2 wk of discontinuing a MAO inhibitor or linezolid. Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and negative cardiovascular evaluation should have their first dose administered in a medically supervised facility. Use not recommended in moderate/severe hepatic impairment. Severe renal impairment (CrCl 5–25 mL/min) reduces zolmitriptan clearance by 25%. Common adverse reactions for all dosage forms unless otherwise indicated include nausea, taste alteration (nasal route), xerostomia, dizziness, hyperesthesia (nasal route), paresthesia, somnolence, sensation of hot and cold, throat pain, and asthenia (oral route). Hypertension, coronary artery spasm, MI, cerebral hemorrhage, and headaches have been reported. For intranasal use, blow nose gently prior to dosing. Block opposite nostril while administering dose by breathing in gently. When using the oral disintegrating tablet (ODT), place the whole tablet on the tongue, allow the tablet to dissolve, and swallow with saliva. Administration with liquids is optional. Do not break the ODT tablet"
Zonisamide,"Anticonvulsant
************
Infant and child (data is incomplete):
        Suggested dosing from a review of Japanese open-label studies for partial and generalized seizures: Start with 1–2 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO. Increase dosage by 0.5–1 mg/ kg/24 hr Q2 wk to the usual dosage range of 5–8 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID PO.
        Recommended higher alternative dosing: Start with 2–4 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID–TID. 
        Gradually increase dosage at 1- to 2-wk intervals to 4–8 mg/kg/24 hr; max. dose: 12 mg/kg/24 hr.

Infantile spasms (regimen that was effective in a small study from Japan; additional studies needed): 
Start with 2–4 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Then increase by 2–5 mg/kg/24 hr every 2–4 day until seizures disappear, up to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/24 hr.

>16 yr–adult:
     Adjunctive therapy for partial seizures: 100 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Dose may be increased to 200 mg PO once daily × 2 wk. Additional dosage increments of 100 mg/24 hr can be made at 2 wk intervals to allow attainment of steady-state levels. Effective doses have ranged from 100 to 600 mg/24 hr ÷ once daily–BID (BID dosing may provide better efficacy). No additional benefit has been shown for doses >400 mg/24 hr.

Because zonisamide is a sulfonamide, it is contraindicated in patients allergic to sulfonamides (may result in Stevens–Johnson syndrome or TEN). Common side effects of drowsiness, ataxia, anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, rash, and pruritis
usually occur early in therapy and can be minimized with slow dose titration. Children are at increased risk for hyperthermia and oligohydrosis, especially in warm or hot weather. Suicidal behavior or ideation, acute pancreatitis, urolithiasis, metabolic acidosis (more frequent and severe in younger patients), DRESS/multiorgan hypersensitivity, rhabdomyolysis and elevated creatinine phosphokinase have been reported. Although not fully delineated, therapeutic serum levels of 20–30 mg/L have been suggested as higher
rates of adverse reactions have been seen at levels > 30 mg/L. Zonisamide is a CYP450 3A4 substrate. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital can decrease levels of zonisamide. Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment; slower dose titration and more frequent monitoring is recommended. Do not use if GFR is < 50 mL/min. Avoid abrupt discontinuation or radical dose reductions. Shallow capsules whole and do not crush or chew"
