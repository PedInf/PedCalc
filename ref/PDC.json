Hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, GI disturbances, IV extravasation, headache, and flushing may occur.\r\nIn addition to its use in chloride supplementation, arginine is used in urea cycle disorder therapy (increases arginine levels and prevents breakdown of endogenous proteins) and as a diagnostic agent for growth hormone (stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone).\r\n",

Use is NOT recommended > 7 days\r\n\r\nContraindicated for patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or who are sensitive to tricyclic antidepressants. \r\nThey should not be used in combination with clozapine because of an increased risk for bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis. \r\nIncreased risk for severe dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN]) has been associated with the HLA-B*1502 (prevalent among Asian\r\ndescent) and HLA-A*3101 (prevalent among Japanese, Native American, Southern Indians, and some Arabic ancestory) alleles.\r\nErythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, cefixime, cimetidine, itraconazole, aprepitant, and INH may increase serum levels. \r\nCarbamazepine may decrease activity of warfarin, doxycycline, oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, theophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and valproic acid. \r\nCarbamazepine is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and inducer of CYP 450 1A2, 2C, and 3A3/4.\r\nThe enzyme-inducing effects may increase effects/toxicity of cyclophosphamide. \r\nCYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase carbamazepine levels/toxicity.\r\nSuggested dosing intervals for specific dosage forms: extended-release tabs or caps (BID); chewable and immediate-release tablets (BID–TID); suspension (QID).\r\nDoses may be administered with food. Do not crush or chew extended-release dosage forms. \r\nShake bottle well prior to dispensing oral suspension dosage form, and do not administer simultaneously with other liquid medicines or diluents.\r\nDrug metabolism typically increases after the first month of therapy initiation because of hepatic autoinduction.\r\nTherapeutic blood levels: 4–12 mg/L. \r\nRecommended serum sampling time: obtain trough level within 30 min prior to an oral dose. \r\nSteady state is typically achieved 1 mo after initiation of therapy (following enzymatic autoinduction). \r\nLevels obtained prior to steady state are useful for preventing toxicity. \r\nBlood levels of 7–10 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders.\r\nSide effects include sedation, dizziness, diplopia, aplastic anemia, neutropenia, urinary retention, nausea, SIADH, and SJS.

Use with caution in renal failure, calcium\r\nchannel blockers (may result in heart block), and adenosine [enhanced depressant effects on sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes]. May cause AV block or dysrhythmias. In\r\npatients treated with digoxin, cardioversion or calcium infusion may lead to ventricular fibrillation (pretreatment with lidocaine may prevent this). Patients with beriberi heart\r\ndisease may not respond to digoxin if underlying thiamine deficiency is not treated concomitantly. Decreased serum potassium and magnesium or increased magnesium and\r\ncalcium may increase risk for digoxin toxicity. For signs and symptoms of toxicity,. Excreted via the kidney; adjust dose in renal failure (). Therapeutic concentration:\r\n0.8–2 ng/mL. Higher doses may be required for supraventricular tachycardia. Neonates, pregnant women, and patients with renal, hepatic, or heart failure may have falsely elevated digoxin levels\r\nbecause of the presence of digoxin-like substances. Digoxin is a CYP450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate. Calcium channel blockers, captopril, carvedilol, amiodarone, quinidine, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tetracycline, and macrolide antibiotics may increase digoxin levels. Use with β-blockers may increase risk for bradycardia.

If adverse reactions occur, stop infusion until side effects subside and may restart at rate that was previously tolerated.\r\n      IM: Administer in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or deltoid muscle of the upper arm.\r\n            Avoid gluteal region because of risk of injury to sciatic nerve. \r\n             Consider splitting doses for multiple injection sites to address age specific maximum IM injection volumes. \r\n     Subcutaneous (SC) preparation:\r\n           Converting to SC route from previous IV dosage for patients receiving IV immune globulin (IVIG) infusions at regular intervals for at least 3 mo (≥2 yr):\r\n                Initial weekly dose (start 1 wk after last IV dose):\r\n                   Dose (g) = 1.53 × Previous IVIG dose in grams (g) ÷ number of weeks between IVIG doses\r\n\r\nTo convert the above dose in grams to milliliters of drug, multiply dose (g) by 5.\r\nAdjust dose over time by clinical response and serum IgG trough levels. Obtain a previous trough level from IVIG therapy prior to SC conversion, and repeat trough level 2–3 mo after initiating the SC route. \r\nA goal trough with the SC route of ~290 mg/dL higher than a trough with the IV route has been recommended.\r\n\r\nSC administration: Injection sites include the abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and/or lateral hip. Doses may be administered into multiple sites (spaced ≥ 2 inches apart) simultaneously.  (missing table)\r\n\r\nUse with caution in patients with an increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., hypercoagulable states, prolonged immobilization, in-dwelling catheters, estrogen use, thrombosis history, cardiovascular risks, and hyperviscosity) or hemolysis (e.g., non-O blood type, associated inflammatory conditions, and receiving high cumulative doses of immune globulins over several days). \r\nMay cause flushing, chills, fever, headache, and hypotension. \r\nHypersensitivity reaction may occur when IV form is administered rapidly. \r\nMaltose containing products may cause an osmotic diuresis. \r\nMay cause anaphylaxis in IgA-deficient patients due to varied amounts of IgA. \r\nSome products are IgA depleted; consult a pharmacist. \r\nTo decrease risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, IV preparations containing sucrose should not be infused at a rate such that the amount of sucrose exceeds 3 mg/kg/min. \r\nSC route provides higher serum trough levels, lower rate of adverse reactions, and shorter administration time when compared with the IV route. \r\nUse an adjusted body weight [ABW = Ideal Body Weight + 0.5 (Actual Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight)] for dosing in obese patients has been recommended. \r\nDelay immunizations after immune globulin administration (see latest AAP Red Book for details).\r\n\r\n",

May cause resistance to neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium). Suggested dosing intervals for specific oral dosage forms: extended-release caps (once daily–BID); chewable tablets, and oral suspension (TID). \r\nOral absorption reduced in neonates. T1/2 is variable (7–42 hr) and dose-dependent. \r\nDrug is highly protein-bound; free fraction of drug will be increased in patients with hypoalbuminemia. \r\nFor seizure disorders, therapeutic levels: 10–20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1–2 mg/L (free only). \r\nMonitor free phenytoin levels in hypoalbuminemia or renal insufficiency. \r\nRecommended serum sampling times: trough level (PO/IV) within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose; peak or postload level (IV) 1 hr after the end of IV infusion. \r\nSteady state is usually achieved after 5–10 days of continuous dosing. \r\nFor routine monitoring, measure trough. \r\nIV push/infusion rate: Not to exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min in neonates, or 1 mg/kg/min infants, children, and adults with max. dose of 50 mg/min; may cause cardiovascular collapse. \r\nConsider fosphenytoin in situations of tenuous IV access and risk for extravasation",

Fatal bronchial anastomotic dehiscence has been reported in lung transplantation. Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis have been\r\nreported in liver transplantation when used with tacrolimus. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. Increase risk of BK virus-associated\r\nnephropathies has been reported. Increased mortality in stable liver transplant patients has been reported after conversion from a calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen to sirolimus. Monitor whole blood trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state), especially with pediatric patients, hepatic impairment, concurrent use of CYP450 3A4 and/or P-gp inducers and inhibitors, and/or if cyclosporine dosage is markedly changed or discontinued. Steady state is generally achieved after 5–7 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on specific treatment protocol and assay methodology (HPLC vs. immunoassay vs. LC/MS/MS). Younger children may exhibit faster sirolimus clearance compared with adolescents. Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP450 3A4 and P-gp. Cyclosporine, diltiazem, protease inhibitors, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, and other inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 may increase the toxicity of sirolimus. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John’s wort may decrease the effects of sirolimus. Strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals and clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., rifamycins) are not recommended. Hypertension, peripheral edema, increase serum creatinine, dyspnea, epistaxis, headache, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arthralgia may occur. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diabetes mellitus, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ovarian cysts, and menstrual disorders have been reported. Urinary tract infections have been reported in pediatric renal transplant patients with high immunologic risk. Two mg of the oral solution has been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to 2 mg tablets. However, it is not known whether they are still therapeutically equivalent at higher doses. Reduce maintenance dosage by 1/3 in the presence of hepatic function impairment. Administer doses consistently with or without food.

PO is the preferred route of administration, and administration should be done on an empty stomach. Safety and efficacy of the extended-release capsules (Astragraf XL) have not been established for kidney transplant patients < 16 yr old. Extended-release tablets (Envarsus XR) are currently labelled for use in adult kidney transplant patients being converted from an immediate-release tacrolimus formulation. An 80% conversion factor has been recommended for African-Americans converted from immediate-release dosage form to Envarsus XR. All extended-release formulations are NOT interchangeable. IV infusions should be administered at concentrations between 0.004 and\r\n0.02 mg/mL diluted with NS or D5W. \r\n\r\nTOPICAL USE: Not recommended for use in patients with skin conditions with a skin barrier defect with the potential for systemic absorption. Do not use in children < 2 yr, immunocompromised patients, or patients with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Approved as a second-line therapy for short-term and intermittent treatment of atopic dermatitis for patients who fail to respond or do not tolerate other approved therapies. Long-term safety is unknown. Skin burn\r\nsensation, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reaction, skin erythema, headache, and skin infection are the most common side effects. Application site edema has been reported. Although the risk is uncertain, the FDA has issued an alert about the potential cancer risk with the use of this product.

See remarks.\r\n       Adult (see remarks): 5–10 mg PO once daily × 2–5 days. Adjust dose to achieve the desired INR or PT. Maintenance dose range: 2–10 mg/24 hr PO once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nContraindicated in severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled bleeding, GI ulcers, and malignant hypertension. \r\nActs on vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X.\r\nSide effects include fever, skin lesions, skin necrosis (especially in protein C deficiency), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and hemoptysis. \r\nWarfarin is a substrate for CYP450 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, and 3A3/4. \r\nChloramphenicol, chloral hydrate, cimetidine, delavirdine, fluconazole, fluoxetine, metronidazole, indomethacin, large doses of vitamins A or E, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, omeprazole, oxandrolone, quinidine, salicylates, SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), sulfonamides, and zafirlukast may increase warfarin’s effect. \r\nAscorbic acid, barbiturates, carbamazepine, cholestyramine, dicloxacillin, griseofulvin, oral contraceptives, rifampin, spironolactone, sucralfate, and vitamin K (including foods with high content) may decrease warfarin’s effect. \r\nYounger children generally require higher doses to achieve desired effect. \r\nA cohort study of 319 children found that infants < 1 yr required an average daily dose of 0.33 mg/kg and teenagers 11–18 yr required 0.09 mg/kg to maintain a target INR of 2–3. Children receiving Fontan cardiac surgery may require smaller doses than children with either congenital heart disease (without Fontan) or no congenital heart disease. [See Chest. 2004;126:645–687S and Blood. 1999;94(9):3007–3014 for additional information.]\r\n\r\nLower initial doses should be considered for patients with pharmacogenetic variations in CYP2C9 (e.g., *2 and *3 alleles) and VKORC1 (e.g., 1639G>A allele) enzymes, elderly and/or debilitated patients, and patients with a potential to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to warfarin. \r\nThe international normalized ratio (INR) is the recommended test to monitor warfarin anticoagulant effect. It takes 5–7 days for an INR to reach steady state on a consistent dosing schedule. \r\nThe particular INR desired is based upon the indication and has been extrapolated from adults. \r\nAn INR of 2–3 has been recommended for prophylaxis and treatment of DVT, pulmonary emboli, and bioprosthetic heart valves. \r\nAn INR of 2.5–3.5 has been recommended for mechanical prosthetic heart valves and the prevention of recurrent systemic emboli. \r\nIf PT is monitored, it should be 1.5–2 times the control. \r\nPatients at high risk for bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring. \r\nOnset of action occurs within 36–72 hr and peak effects occur within 5–7 days. \r\nIV dosing is equivalent to PO doses and is used in situations where oral dosing is not possible. \r\nThe antidote is vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. \r\nPregnancy category is “D” for women with mechanical heart valves and “X” for all others indications",
